# Nexus RPG

Welcome to Nexus RPG. A sword and sorcery TTRPG with wide mechanical options set in a world inspired by real-world ancient cultures from across the earth.

In this game, you will play as a daring group of adventurers with individual skill sets. Choose freely from different skills, which each provide different sets of abilities, to craft your character.

## Disclaimer

While this game has been in development for the last 4 years, it is still under active development and only has been playtested for a few times.
All rules, player options, and other content are subject to change.
The content of this game will still change frequently and without notice (though I try to list all major changes in the github release notes).
