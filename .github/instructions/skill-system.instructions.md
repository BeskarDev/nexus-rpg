# Skill Talent System Design Guide

Purpose
This guide defines a clear, usable process for creating fiction-first talents tied to skills. It presents the roles we use to evaluate talents, a role-spread for each skill, the one-word aspects that seed flavour, and a practical workflow to generate a variety of talents that support different playstyles.

1 — Design principles
- Fiction-first by default: Describe any talent without relying on gameplay mechanics but only a narrative view.
- Roles as lenses: Treat one of six roles as a primary design lens for each talent, but permit talents to serve multiple complementary roles.  

2 — Roles (what each designer lens means)
- Offense: threatens, damages or removes opposition.  
- Defense: protects, mitigates harm, or creates safe posture.  
- Healing: restores or relieves physical, mental, or social harm.  
- Control: shapes enemy behaviour or the environment to your advantage.  
- Support: empowers allies, organises groups, or reshapes social outcomes.  
- Utility: exploration, knowledge, travel, resource creation and scene tools.

Role labels used in spreads: Excels (primary), Decent (secondary), Weak (rare / subversive).
