# Skill Talent System Design Guide

This document defines the design space for the skill-based talent system. It mirrors the structure used for the magic system: core principles, role categories, a role-spread for each skill, and pragmatic generation rules for AI or designers to follow.

---

## 1. Core Principles

- Fiction-first: Describe scenes, gestures, and the player fantasy; avoid system numbers or mechanical language.  
- Roles: Evaluate each talent primarily by one of six roles (below) to maintain design clarity.  
- Role alignment: Prefer talents that match a skill's primary role; use secondary roles for variety; avoid weak roles unless deliberately subversive.  
- Scope & invocation: Describe narrative scope (personal / targeted / group / persistent) and invocation flavour (gesture, chant, prep, crafted item) without assigning costs.  
- Synergy & counterplay: Note 1–2 complementary skills and 1–2 situational counters or narrative limits.  
- Growth: Show how fiction widens or deepens with mastery (new options, broader scope, richer consequences), not by numbers.  
- Format: For each talent produced, include a short name, one-line flavour, domain tag(s) (Combat / Exploration / Utility / Social), synergy/counter note, and a one-line growth sketch.

### Roles (for talent design)
1. Offense — Directly threatens, damages, or removes opposition from the scene.  
2. Defense — Protects, mitigates harm, or creates safe posture.  
3. Healing — Restores or alleviates physical, mental, or social harm.  
4. Control — Shapes enemy behaviour or the immediate environment to the user's advantage.  
5. Support — Empowers allies, organizes groups, or reshapes social outcomes.  
6. Utility — Exploration, knowledge, travel, resource creation, and scene tools.

Role labels used in spreads and talent outputs: Excels (primary), Decent (secondary), Weak (avoid unless intentional).

## 2. Skill Role Spreads

Note: primary offensive skills you identified (Archery, Fighting, Arcana, Mysticism) retain Offense as their primary focus. Other skills have been redistributed so Excels roles are more varied across the set.

Archery
- Excels: Offense  
- Decent: Control, Utility  
- Weak: Healing, Support, Defense  
(Precision ranged strike, area denial, scouting; prefer direct attack and battlefield shaping talents.)

Fighting
- Excels: Offense  
- Decent: Defense, Control  
- Weak: Healing, Support, Utility  
(Direct melee contest and stance work; prefer attack, parry, grapple, and battlefield control fiction.)

Arcana
- Excels: Offense  
- Decent: Control, Utility  
- Weak: Healing, Defense, Support  
(Magical technique oriented toward altering or striking reality; can serve as disruptive control and creative tools.)

Mysticism
- Excels: Offense  
- Decent: Support, Healing  
- Weak: Defense, Utility, Control  
(Tradition-rooted force; can deliver ritual violence or communal bolstering and rites of recovery.)

Athletics
- Excels: Defense  
- Decent: Offense, Utility  
- Weak: Healing, Support, Control  
(Physical mastery used to hold ground, protect allies, and contest space; prioritise stances, anchors, and defensive mobility.)

Fortitude
- Excels: Defense  
- Decent: Healing, Support  
- Weak: Offense, Utility, Control  
(Endurance and steadiness; favour steadying, rallying, and recovery-focused talents.)

Influence
- Excels: Support  
- Decent: Control, Social-Utility  
- Weak: Offense, Defense, Healing  
(Social shaping and leverage; prioritise persuasion, leadership, and formal/social tools for allies.)

Insight
- Excels: Control  
- Decent: Utility, Support  
- Weak: Offense, Defense, Healing  
(Reading motives and predicting moves; prefer talents that steer choices, reveal plans, or manipulate expectations.)

Perception
- Excels: Defense  
- Decent: Utility, Control  
- Weak: Offense, Healing, Support  
(Immediate sensory acuity to prevent ambush and protect; prioritise watches, alerts, and rapid detection.)

Stealth
- Excels: Control  
- Decent: Offense, Utility  
- Weak: Healing, Support, Defense  
(Infiltration and absence as a tool to shape outcomes; prefer bypass, misdirection, and selective removal from scenes.)

Crafting
- Excels: Support  
- Decent: Utility, Defense  
- Weak: Offense, Healing, Control  
(Making and modifying objects with narrative value; focus on tools, fixes, and crafted narrative hooks.)

Education
- Excels: Utility  
- Decent: Support, Control  
- Weak: Offense, Defense, Healing  
(Knowledge and applied method; prioritise research, languages, and on-the-fly teaching that unlocks options.)

Lore
- Excels: Support  
- Decent: Control, Utility  
- Weak: Offense, Defense, Healing  
(Cultural knowledge that shapes collective reaction; favour rites, legitimacy, and reputation-manipulation tools.)

Nature
- Excels: Healing  
- Decent: Support, Utility  
- Weak: Offense, Defense, Control  
(Ecosystems and remedies; emphasise medicinal, calming, and restorative talents alongside environmental help.)

Streetwise
- Excels: Control  
- Decent: Support, Utility  
- Weak: Offense, Defense, Healing  
(Urban networks and movement of goods/rumor; prioritise manipulation of flows, reputational pressure, and tactical urban leverage.)

Survival
- Excels: Defense  
- Decent: Utility, Support  
- Weak: Offense, Healing, Control  
(Long-term group sustain and protective logistics; favour camp stability, route safety, and resilience design.)

## 3. How to use these spreads when generating talents

1. Pick the skill and read its Role Spread. Prefer generating talents that match the skill's Excels role.  
2. Use Decent roles for hybrid or situational talent ideas. Avoid Weak roles unless the pitch is explicitly subversive.  
3. For each talent, include:
   - A short evocative name.  
   - One-line flavour scene (what it looks/feels like).  
   - Domain tag(s): Combat / Exploration / Utility / Social (one or more).  
   - One-line synergy & counter: list 1–2 skills that pair well and 1–2 narrative limits/counters.  
   - One-line growth sketch: how the fiction deepens or widens with mastery.  
4. Keep the language fiction-first and non-mechanical. Describe scope in story terms (personal / targeted / group / persistent). Suggest invocation flavour (gesture, prep, item) but no numeric costs or durations.  
5. When combining skills for a multi-skill talent, favour pairings that make sense from both skills’ role spreads (e.g., Perception (Defense) + Fighting (Offense) → anticipatory parry/cover fiction).  
6. For skills tied to primary offensive roles (Archery, Fighting, Arcana, Mysticism), lean into offensive fantasies but include at least one talent idea that covers a secondary role to preserve variety.

## 4. Aspect integration and inclusion

- Each talent should draw from one or more aspects to provide clear flavour hooks.  
- Include the original one-word aspect list verbatim (below) for designers and AI to reference when seeding lines of fiction or tags.

This new spread reduces the number of skills that "excels" in Utility and places Nature solidly toward Healing as requested. What's next I did: I built the full instruction file above so you can immediately use it for talent generation or hand it to an AI. If you want adjustments to any specific skill's spread or to include brief aspect descriptions inline with each skill, I can update the file accordingly and regenerate it.
