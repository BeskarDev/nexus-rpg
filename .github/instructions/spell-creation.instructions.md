# Spell Creation Instructions for Nexus RPG

## Quick Reference

### Magic Schools

| School | Philosophy | Casting | Spell Power | Focus | Catalyst |
|--------|------------|---------|-------------|-------|----------|
| **Arcana** | Transgressive mental power | Mind + Arcana | ½ Mind | (Mind-2) + 2×Arcana | Arcane conduit |
| **Mysticism** | Reverent spiritual channeling | Spirit + Mysticism | ½ Spirit | (Spirit-2) + 2×Mysticism | Mystic talisman |

**Failure Consequences**: Arcana = mishap table, Mysticism = lose access until penance

## Damage Scaling Guidelines

### Standard Scaling
- **Single-target**: +2 weak damage per rank (2→4→6→8→10)
- **AoE**: One rank lower than single-target
- **Rank 0 AoE**: Special case +0/+2/+4 (unlimited casting balance)

### Deviation Scenarios

| Scenario | Adjustment | Rationale | Example |
|----------|------------|-----------|---------|
| **Smaller area** | Up to standard rank | Fewer targets, higher risk | Rank 2 melee AoE: +6/+12/+18 |
| **Larger area** | Two ranks lower | More targets, easier | Rank 2 medium area: +2/+4/+6 |
| **Strong secondary** | -1 to -2 steps | Trade damage for utility | +4/+8/+12 → +3/+6/+9 |
| **Control-primary** | Minimal damage | Powerful effect justifies | Rank 0 fear: +0/+2/+4 |
| **Chain/split** | Secondary reduced | Divide power | Primary +2/+4/+6, chain +0/+2/+4 |

**Balance Principle**: Total spell power stays consistent within rank through trade-offs.

## Power Level Constraints

### Rank 5 Limits (Peak Mortal Power)
1. **Damage**: Max +10 weak, +20 strong, +30 critical (single-target)
2. **Area**: Large zones, not "entire battlefield"
3. **Duration**: Medium maximum (not permanent)
4. **Effects**: Powerful but escapable/counterable
5. **No Instant Wins**: No auto-kills or permanent solutions
6. **Concentration**: Most require it (can be broken)
7. **Bounded Power**: Impressive but mortal-scale, not reality-warping

**Good D&D Level 7 Models**: Delayed Blast Fireball, Plane Shift, Finger of Death, Reverse Gravity, Forcecage, Etherealness, Regenerate

**Avoid D&D Level 9 Power**: Wish, True Resurrection, Meteor Swarm, Time Stop, Imprisonment

## Spell Creation Checklist

### Theme & Identity
- [ ] Fits tradition/discipline aspects (check magic system instructions)
- [ ] Aligns with Excels/Decent roles (avoid Weak roles)
- [ ] Uses appropriate damage types
- [ ] Arcane feels transgressive/selfish, Mystic feels reverent/communal
- [ ] Includes 1-3 aspects in flavor

### Mechanics
- [ ] Rank appropriate for power level
- [ ] Damage follows scaling guidelines (or has justified deviation)
- [ ] Success levels provide meaningful scaling (Weak/Strong/Critical)
- [ ] Range appropriate for effect power
- [ ] Duration specified clearly (briefly/short/medium/long)
- [ ] Properties correctly applied
- [ ] Spell Power formula clear (+ bonus or absolute value)

### Balance
- [ ] Not strictly superior to existing spells
- [ ] Provides interesting tactical choices
- [ ] Edge cases considered
- [ ] Rank 5 respects power ceiling (D&D 7, not 9)
- [ ] Deviations from standard scaling justified by trade-offs

### Writing Quality
- [ ] Flavor description evocative
- [ ] Mechanical terms in **bold**
- [ ] Tradition/discipline names in *italics*
- [ ] Targeting clear ("vs. Dodge", "vs. Resist")
- [ ] Effects unambiguous

## Spell Writing Template

```markdown
### Spell Name (*tradition/discipline*, Rank X)
**Properties:** [quick, concentrate, enchant (duration), etc.]

**Effect**
[Evocative flavor description of casting and visual effect]
**Weak.** [Base mechanical effect with numbers and durations]
**Strong.** [Enhanced effect, typically 2× power]
**Critical.** [Maximum effect, typically 3× power]

[Optional heightening rules if spell scales well]
[Optional additional utility applications]
```

**Example**:
```markdown
### Chromatic Orb (*evocation*, Rank 1)
**Effect**
You conjure a crackling sphere of elemental energy and hurl it at your foe. Choose fire, frost, or lightning when casting.
**Weak.** Deal +4 damage of chosen type.
**Strong.** Deal +8 damage. Fire: target is burning. Frost: target is slowed. Lightning: arcs to one adjacent enemy for +2 damage.
**Critical.** Deal +12 damage. Apply appropriate condition for short duration.

**Heighten.** For each additional rank of Focus spent, damage increases by +4/+8/+12 (weak/strong/critical).
```

## Common Design Patterns

### Damage Spells
- Single-target: Standard damage progression by rank
- AoE: One rank lower, specify area (cone/line/burst)
- Hybrid: Reduced damage + condition/utility effect
- Consider damage type implications (burning, slowed, stunned, etc.)

### Control Spells
- Target Resist TN (6 + rank)
- Duration appropriate to rank (briefly → medium max)
- Condition from appropriate list for tradition/discipline
- Strong/Critical increase duration or targets

### Utility Spells
- Non-combat applications emphasized
- Exploration, travel, communication, knowledge
- Scale by scope (targets, area, duration, information detail)
- Rank 0 = limited/simple, Rank 5 = extensive/complex

### Buff/Debuff Spells
- Numeric bonuses modest (+1 to +3 typical)
- Duration limits power (briefly for strong effects, longer for weaker)
- enchant property for temporary enhancements
- Clear end conditions (concentration, time, dispel)

## Design Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Power Creep**: Making spells strictly better than existing options
❌ **Complexity Overflow**: Requiring extensive subsystems or edge-case tracking
❌ **Theme Drift**: Creating effects outside tradition/discipline identity
❌ **Balance Blindness**: Ignoring spell interaction with other abilities
❌ **Vague Wording**: Ambiguous targeting, duration, or mechanical effects
❌ **Weak Role Violation**: Creating spells in categories the tradition/discipline should avoid

---

## Final Reminders

**Design Order**:
1. Choose tradition/discipline and check aspects/roles
2. Determine appropriate rank for desired power level
3. Select damage types and conditions from allowed list
4. Write evocative flavor tied to aspects
5. Assign mechanical values using scaling guidelines
6. Validate against checklist

**Core Philosophy**: Spells should provide meaningful tactical choices within a coherent thematic framework, respecting the bounded power ceiling and the distinction between transgressive Arcana and reverent Mysticism.
