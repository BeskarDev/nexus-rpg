# Talent System Design Guidelines for Nexus RPG

## Core Design Goals
- Provide **gameable, concrete abilities** (clear triggers, effects, limits).
- Ensure **skill-internal diversity**: each skill should support combat, utility, and downtime play.
- Allow talents to combine across skills for **archetype playstyles**, but not depend on it.
- Keep **power bounded**: Rank 5 = mortal pinnacle, roughly equivalent to D&D 10–12. No reality-defying powers.
- Share power growth with **magic items**. Talents provide unique options; items provide potency.
- Maintain **cultural/mythic flavor** evocative of Bronze Age sword & sorcery.

## Rank Structure & Scaling
- **Rank 1 (Novice)**: Unlocks a new playstyle or option (dual wielding, tracking, ritual chants).
- **Rank 2 (Adept)**: Adds a payoff ability or flourish to the playstyle (synergy, situational boon).
- **Rank 3 (Expert)**: Characters earn renown. Abilities become signature moves; provide reliability and encounter-shaping tools.
- **Rank 4 (Master)**: Among the best in a city-state or province. Abilities bend encounters, expand scope (affecting squads, whole journeys).
- **Rank 5 (Grandmaster)**: Pinnacle of mortal skill. Legendary mastery that defines the limit of human ability without breaking reality.

**Scaling Principles**
- Growth comes from **efficiency, reliability, and breadth**, not raw damage inflation.
- Flat bonuses should be modest; tie boosts to **conditions or triggers**.
- Each rank progression: **unlock → payoff → mastery → mythic.**

## Talent Content Guidelines
1. **Clarity & Precision**
   - Always specify *when, how often, under what conditions*.
   - Avoid vague narrative effects; every talent must be mechanically actionable.

2. **Combat Options**
   - Each skill should include offensive, defensive, and reactive abilities.
   - Cover diverse reactions: enemy actions, ally actions, environment hazards.

3. **Defensive & Reactive Play**
   - Essential in a lethal combat system.
   - Categories: **Avoidance, Mitigation, Redirection, Counterplay.**
   - Must be reliable but not automatic; attach costs (actions, uses, conditions).

4. **Utility & Downtime**
   - All skills should provide at least some talents for exploration, travel, or downtime.

5. **Synergies**
   - **Intra-Playstyle**: reward doubling down on a style.
   - **Inter-Skill**: combine two skills meaningfully.
   - **Team Synergy**: talents that trigger off ally actions/positioning.
   - Synergies should feel rewarding, not mandatory.

6. **Item Interaction**
   - Talents should complement, not duplicate, item effects.
   - Synergy with equipment is expected for late-game balance.

## Bonus Types
To prevent stacking abuse, bonuses use fixed categories. **Only the highest bonus of a given type applies.** Different types stack.

**List of Bonus Types**
1. **Ability Bonus** – from attributes (STR, AGI, SPI, MND).
2. **Skill Bonus** – from ranks or talents tied to that skill.
3. **Item Bonus** – from weapons, armor, tools, or magic items.
4. **Situational Bonus** – from conditions, positioning, or talent triggers.
5. **Armor Bonus** – for defense/soak values.
6. **Other (Named)** – unique cases, e.g. *Blessing Bonus*.

## Talent Design Checklist
When designing a new talent, ask:

✅ Does it **unlock, expand, or master** a playstyle appropriate for its rank?  
✅ Does it fit within one of the **skill’s themes**?  
✅ Does it provide options for **combat, utility, or downtime**?  
✅ Does it have a **clear trigger, effect, and limit**?  
✅ If numerical, does it use a **defined bonus type**?  
✅ Does it create or reward **synergies** (playstyle, cross-skill, or team)?  
✅ Does it interact cleanly with **items and core resolution mechanics**?  
✅ Does it respect the **bounded power ceiling** (Rank 5 ≠ superheroes)?
