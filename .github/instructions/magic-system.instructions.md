# Fantasy Magic System Design Guide

This document defines the **design space** for a fantasy tabletop RPG magic system with **Mystic (Traditions) and Arcane (Disciplines) magic**. It is intended to guide spell generation, focusing on **themes, aspects, damage types, and role identities**, rather than specific mechanics.

---

## 1. Core Principles

### Mystic (Traditions)
- Rooted in spiritual, divine, and primal forces.  
- Respectful of natural and cosmic order.  
- Magic is often communal, supportive, or tied to life/death cycles.  
- Traditions reflect values, oaths, and cosmic principles.

### Arcane (Disciplines)
- Selfish, transgressive, or unnatural.  
- Magic bends or violates natural laws for personal gain.  
- Often offensive, manipulative, or exploitative.  
- Disciplines reflect control over reality, mind, elements, or death without reverence.

### Magic Categories
All magic can be evaluated across **6 broad roles** for spell design:
1. **Offense** – Dealing damage or destructive effects.  
2. **Defense** – Shields, barriers, or protective effects.  
3. **Healing** – Restoring vitality or curing afflictions.  
4. **Control** – Hindering or manipulating enemies or the environment.  
5. **Support** – Empowering allies or providing beneficial effects.  
6. **Utility** – Exploration, knowledge, travel, and environmental manipulation.  

#### Role Spread
- **Excels (1)**: primary focus of the Tradition/Discipline.  
- **Decent (2)**: secondary capabilities.  
- **Weak (3)**: minimal or ineffective; should avoid these roles.

## 4. AI Spell Design Guidelines

When generating a spell for this system:

1. **Identify the Tradition/Discipline**:  
   - Reference the **aspects** for thematic flavor.  
   - Align spell effects with the **core identity** of the magic (offensive, supportive, utility, etc.).

2. **Role Alignment**:  
   - Prefer generating spells in the **Excels category**.  
   - Secondary options may include **Decent categories**.  
   - Avoid Weak categories unless intentionally subversive.

3. **Aspect Integration**:  
   - Each spell should incorporate **one or more aspects** for flavor.  

4. **Damage Type Integration**:  
   - Use one or more **assigned damage types** for the Tradition/Discipline.  
   - Even supportive or utility-focused magic should have **at least some offensive options**, aligned with thematic identity.  
   - Multi-effect spells may combine **two or three damage types** for variety.  
   - Refer to **damage notes** to preserve thematic flavor (e.g., Life internal overload, Necromancy decay, Twilight mind attacks).

5. **Consistency with Tradition/Discipline Identity**:  
   - Mystic Traditions: Spells should feel reverent, orderly, or life-affirming.  
   - Arcane Disciplines: Spells should feel selfish, transgressive, or unnatural.  

6. **Spell Variety Guidance**:  
   - Use **primary aspect** for core effect.  
   - Combine **secondary aspects** for added versatility or thematic depth.  
   - Consider **opposing aspects** for tension (optional): e.g., Life + Nature for growth; Necromancy + Evocation for destructive decay.
