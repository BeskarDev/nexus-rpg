# Magic Item Design — Nexus RPG

Magic items are assembled from components with a strict cost formula. The canonical tables live in the docs — **always read the relevant table before assigning costs or effects; never price from memory.** Core system mechanics and writing standards: [../game-basics.md](../game-basics.md).

The analysis doc contains **proposed but not-yet-implemented changes** (splitting armor/shield enchantment tables, removing the catalyst enchantment table, d100 conversion, minor-enchantment rule). Check it before designing enchantments — don't build on top of a structure that's slated for rework without flagging it.

## Cost Formula

```
Total Cost = Base Item + Magic Item Base Cost + Special Material (optional) + Enchantment (optional)
```

**Exception: wearables (rings, amulets, boots, cloaks…) skip the Magic Item Base Cost** — they only gain value from their enchantment.

Quality tiers at a glance:

| Quality | Name | Value Range | Auto Bonus (weapon dmg / AV) | For Levels |
|---------|------|-------------|------------------------------|------------|
| Q3 | Masterwork | 250–750 | — (non-magical) | 1–2 |
| Q4 | Formidable | 750–3,000 | +1 | 2–4 |
| Q5 | Exceptional | 2,500–15,000 | +2 | 5–7 |
| Q6 | Epic | 7,500–45,000 | +3 | 8–10 |
| Q7 | Legendary | 25,000–150,000 | +4 | 10+ |
| Q8 | Mythical | 75,000–450,000 | +5 | unique artifacts |

Durability bonus by quality: +1d/+1d/+2d/+2d/+3d (Q4–Q8). Magic ammo uses flat damage +1…+6 (Q3–Q8). Exact numbers per item type: `effects.md`.

## Design Principles

1. **Anti-trivialization** — enchantments grant boons on rolls, not auto-success. Resource management (supplies, fatigue, durability) must stay meaningful.
2. **Talent harmony** — enchantments complement talents, never replace them. A +1 boon on Perception adds to a talent's ability; it doesn't substitute for it.
3. **Limited resource discipline** — powerful active effects cost limited uses (X/day, 1/scene), not passive always-on scaling.
4. **GM-ease for information effects** — non-combat enchantments that reveal information must define what the GM reveals, how often, at what scope. No vague "you sense danger".
5. **One enchantment per item** — hard limit. Same-effect enchantments on multiple items don't stack (highest applies); active abilities aren't blocked by this.
6. **Match power to level** — see quality table. Q6+ in a level-1 party breaks the game economy and math.
7. **Thematic materials** — dragon scales from dragon hoards, mithril from dwarf vaults. Prefer materials the party could plausibly have harvested.
8. **Damage/healing effects follow the spell scaling frameworks** — `docs/analysis/spells/SPELL_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md` §6 (damage per rank, AoE half-scaling) and §16 (healing: single-target 1:1 with damage, Quick Action ½, AoE half; temp HP never stacks; wound healing extremely rare). An item's effect must not exceed what a same-tier spell delivers — quality tier ≈ spell rank as the power yardstick (healing potion ≈ the equivalent-rank healing spell).
9. **Never gate an ongoing effect on a static-TN save** — a flat difficulty (`roll vs. 8`) trivializes as characters grow (attribute die + 1d6 + skill vs. a fixed number is a near-autopass by mid-tier), so a recurring "save or suffer" is meaningless at higher levels. Enforce recurring effects through mechanics that don't decay with level instead: forced or forbidden actions, compulsions, mounting/unremovable Fatigue, contextual banes, or opportunity cost. If a roll is genuinely needed, scale its difficulty to the character (vs. their own Resist/Defense, or an escalating TN), never a bare constant.
10. **A drawback must enact its own fiction, not tax a generic stat** — a curse or penalty should mechanically *make the character behave the cursed way*, not just deduct an unrelated resource. Paranoia forces isolation to rest; wrath compels retaliation; a cruel-tongue curse simply forbids lying. A flat attribute-die reduction or generic Fatigue hit that has nothing to do with the theme is lazy and inert. Ask "does this mechanic produce the behaviour the fiction describes?" Also do not touch **Resolve** (special meta-currency) — drawbacks trade in Fatigue, Wounds, HP, banes, or forced/forbidden actions.

## Creation Workflow

1. **Purpose & power** — who is it for (level → quality tier), what role (combat, utility, defense, spellcasting), how rare, what makes it memorable.
2. **Base item** — martials: weapons/armor/shields; casters: spell catalysts, wearables; utility: wearables; consumables: potions/scrolls/ammo.
3. **Quality tier** — from the level table above.
4. **Special material (optional)** — read `materials.md`, pick thematically. Material quality range must fit item quality (exotic Q3–Q4, greater Q5–Q6, legendary Q7–Q8).
5. **Enchantment (optional, max one)** — read `enchantments.md`. Match enchantment type to item type. Active abilities for tactical decisions, passive for reliable benefit. Verify the enchantment's quality scaling covers your tier.
6. **Calculate cost** — read `cost-tables.md`, apply the formula, show the breakdown line by line (see examples below). Remember the wearable exception.
7. **Write description** — evocative name, visual appearance, 1–2 sentences of lore for significant items, then exact mechanical effects: bonuses, active ability usage (action type, duration, uses/day), limitations.
8. **Format** — for printable cards, produce JSON (format below).

## Worked Cost Examples

**Q4 Flaming Longsword +1**: 100 (base longsword) + 1,000 (Q4 one-handed magic base) + 1,000 (Q4 flaming enchantment) = **2,100 coins**

**Q5 Mithril Breastplate +2**: 750 (base) + 10,000 (Q5 heavy armor magic base) + 5,000 (Q5 mithril) = **15,750 coins**

**Q4 Amulet of Protection**: 50 (base amulet) + 0 (wearable — skips magic base cost!) + 1,000 (Q4 wearable enchantment) = **1,050 coins**

**Q6 Flameheart Greatsword +3**: 150 (base) + 15,000 (Q6 two-handed) + 7,500 (Q6 dragon bone) + 15,000 (Q6 flaming) = **37,650 coins**

## Treasure Distribution

- **Minor (per session)**: 1–2 consumables (Q3–Q4), 50–500 coins each.
- **Major (per arc, 3–5 sessions)**: 1 permanent item at character-level-appropriate quality.
- **Legendary (campaign milestones)**: unique named Q6+ items with materials, enchantments, and backstory.

Don't make every treasure magical — mix coins, trade goods, consumables.

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ Stacking multiple enchantments on one item.
- ❌ Charging wearables the magic item base cost.
- ❌ Inventing homebrew enchantments when an existing one fits — extend `enchantments.md` only as a deliberate design decision, checked against the analysis doc.
- ❌ Skipping the cost breakdown — value drives the game economy.
- ❌ Vague active abilities — always state action type, duration, and uses.
- ❌ Non-official keywords — conditions only from `docs/05-combat/04-conditions.md`, durations only briefly/short/medium/long/very long (`docs/06-scenes/02-effect-durations.md`), item properties only from `docs/04-equipment/05-armor-weapon-properties.md`. Complete lists: [../game-basics.md](../game-basics.md#canonical-keyword-sources).

## JSON Format (printable cards)

```json
{
  "name": "Frostbite +1",
  "category": "Weapon",
  "quality": 4,
  "type": "longsword +1",
  "material": "Glacial Steel",
  "cost": 2100,
  "load": 1,
  "description": "Forged from steel tempered in glacial waters, the blade emits a faint mist of frost. While wielding this weapon, you can use a Quick Action on your turn to encase it in frost for a short duration. While frosted, the weapon deals 2 frost damage (ignoring AV) on a hit and emits dim light in close range.",
  "properties": "slash, pierce, versatile (+1)"
}
```

- **Required**: `name` (include bonus, e.g. "Longsword +2"), `category` (`Weapon` | `Armor` | `Wearable` | `Consumable` | `Spell Scroll`), `quality` (3–8), `type` (base type + bonus, or slot for wearables e.g. `"ring (apparel slot)"`), `cost`, `load`, `description`.
- **Optional**: `material`, `properties` (comma-separated string), `uses` (consumables, typically 1).
- Multiple items: JSON array. Printing UI: `docs/10-gm-tools/00-printing/03-magic-items.mdx`.

## Optional Rules (use when the owner asks)

- **Attunement**: short rest to bond, max 3 attuned items per character.
- **Cursed items**: now a defined subsystem in `docs/04-equipment/07-magic-items/curses.mdx` (found loot only, GM-chosen not forced-roll, permanent equip/wield items only, d12 curse table). Each curse pairs a comply-benefit with a defy-price and must obey principles 9 and 10 (no static-TN saves, drawback enacts its own fiction, never touches Resolve). *Break Curse* suppresses an item curse temporarily rather than destroying it; permanent removal needs destroying the item or fulfilling its release condition.
- **Artifacts (beyond Q8)**: may break standard rules (multiple enchantments, intelligence, growth) — sparingly, for major story beats only.

## Publication Pipeline

Two distinct cases — don't confuse them:

**Individual treasure items** (the common case): campaign-specific loot is NOT published to docs or Notion. Deliverable = the item description + cost breakdown, plus the printable-card JSON if requested. Ephemeral output.

**Rules-table changes** (new enchantment, material, cost tier — only as a deliberate, owner-approved design decision):
1. **Docs** — update the canonical table in `docs/04-equipment/07-magic-items/` (enchantments.md, materials.md, cost-tables.md, effects.md).
2. **App JSON** — update the matching `src/utils/data/json/magic-item-*.json` file (consumed by app tools). ⚠️ Edit directly — legacy regeneration scripts are deprecated.
3. **Notion** — push via the `notion-sync` skill.
4. Check `docs/analysis/enchantments-magic-items-analysis.md` — if the change touches an area with a pending rework proposal, flag it to the owner first.

Verify docs and JSON agree, then commit together.

## Designer Feedback Loop

When the owner corrects a design decision (costing, enchantment power, distribution pacing), add it to Design Principles above so it persists for future sessions.
