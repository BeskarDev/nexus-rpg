# ⭐ Adventures & XP

## Adventures

The very reason your adventurers set out on epic journeys and risk their life for glory and wealth.

Over the course of an adventurers life, they will face escalating challenges of ever increasing threat.

### Tiers of Adventure

| Adventuring Tier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 (fresh) | Basic adventuring tasks such as escorting travelers, gathering information, and performing simple errands. |
| 2 (capable) | More complex and challenging missions such as investigating strange occurrences, rescuing hostages, and battling small groups of foes. |
| 3 (experienced) | Difficult and dangerous adventures involving magical threats, overthrowing local forces, and slaying supernatural creatures. |
| 4 (seasoned) | High-stakes missions such as penetrating enemy fortresses, exploring ancient ruins, and engaging in battles with powerful foes. |
| 5 (heroic) | Heroic deeds such as uncovering sinister conspiracies, facing powerful magical beings, and leading large-scale battles. |
| 6 (legendary)  | Epic quests that determine the fate of kingdoms and nations, such as stopping a massive invasion, overthrowing a tyrant, or preventing a cataclysmic event. |

### End of Gaming Session

At the end of a gaming session, each adventurer gains XP based on what they accomplished during that session.

If they were actively pursuing the adventure goal, they each gained 1 XP.

If they resolve an adventure during that gaming session, they each gain XP based on the difficulty of the adventure.

> “Adventures” below these difficulties are not considered actual adventures and therefore award no XP. Rescuing a cat from a tree is no adventure.
> 

| Difficulty | XP Reward |
| --- | --- |
| Risky (some risk of injuries or death, completed in one or two gaming sessions) | 2 XP |
| Dangerous (a very high risk of dying, completed throughout several gaming sessions) | 3 XP |
| Epic (a miracle you made it through alive, completed over a large amount of gaming sessions) | 4 XP |

## Experience Points (XP)

In between adventurers, the group can spend their XP on different aspects of their characters during downtime. The group can decide on the length of their in-game downtime or the GM can set a limit until the next adventure awaits. Spending XP to improve something about your character also has to be explainable in the world of the characters. So improving a skill might require finding a mentor or studying at some place.

While XP has to be spent upfront, you don‘t have to spend the required time all at once. So you can train over multiple downtimes to unlock a single improvement.

| Improvement | XP Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Improve Skill | 1 or more XP |
| Improve Attribute One Step | 4 XP |

### Learn New Skills

You start the game with several skills you already learned based on your upbringing and background. You can learn entirely new skills during downtime by spending time and coins. At the end of that time, you learn a new skill and can improve it with XP. You can only ever learn up to 12 skills.

### Improve Skills

Adventurers can learn and improve different skills. You start at rank 0 and with 0 XP for any skill you have learned. Skills you haven’t learned are treated as untrained for you. 

You can spend your XP, time, and coins to improve your skills. Once you invest at least 2 XP in a skill, you are trained in that skill at rank 1. You can add that rank as a bonus to any rolls with the skill and can learn to rank 1 talent for that skill.

As you spend more XP, you advance your rank in that skill at certain thresholds. This increases your bonus on rolls, as well as your access to talents for that skill. You can never spend more than 30 XP on any single skill.

| Skill Rank | 0 (apprentice) | 1 (novice) | 2 (adept) | 3 (expert) | 4 (master) | 5 (grandmaster) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spend XP | 0-1 | 2-5 | 6-11 | 12-19 | 20-29 | 30 |

### Optional Rule: XP Pacing

> Consider using this rule, if your group prefers a more paced approach to how much XP they can spend on individual skills and attributes.
> 

With this optional rule, the maximum amount of XP you can spend in each skill is determined by the total amount of XP you have spent so far.

For example, when starting a new adventuring campaign at the default start, you start with 6 spend XP in total (2 XP over three skills). Any XP you gain from your adventures allows you to invest 2 XP per skill more (up to 4 XP per skill total). Once you spend 12 XP in total on your skills and attributes (i.e. with 4 XP in three different skills, or 4 XP in two different skills and 4 XP for upgrading one attribute dice by one step), you are now able to invest up to 8 XP per skill instead and even increase your attributes to up to a d10.

| Adventuring Tier | Tier 1 (fresh) | Tier 2 (capable) | Tier 3 (experienced) | Tier 4 (seasoned) | Tier 5 (heroic) | Tier 6 (legendary)  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Total XP Spend On Skills | ≥ 0 XP | ≥ 12 XP | ≥ 24 XP | ≥ 36 XP | ≥ 48 XP | ≥ 60 XP |
| Max. XP per Skill | 4 XP each (Rank 1) | 8 XP each (Rank 2)  | 12 XP each (Rank 3) | 16 XP each (Rank 3) | 20 XP each (Rank 4) | 30 XP each (Rank 5) |
| Max. Attribute Dice | d8 | d10 | d10 | d12 | d12 | d12 |

### Learning Talents

> Every 2 XP in a skill unlocks a new talent at rank 1 or a new rank for an existing talent.
> 

Your spent XP in a skill determines how many ranks of talents you can learn for that skill (2 XP per talent rank). Choose any number of talent ranks with a total XP cost up to the amount of spent XP in your skill. You can only choose a talent rank of equal or lower value than your associated skill rank if you unlocked all of the talent’s previous ranks.

Talents can be learned immediately during your training time when spending the XP for a skill. You can also hold onto your spend XP in a skill when you are saving up for talent. You must first learn a lower rank of a talent before acquiring its next higher rank.
