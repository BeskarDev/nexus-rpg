# ⭐ Adventures & XP

## Adventures

The very reason your adventurers set out on epic journeys and risk their life for glory and wealth.

Over the course of an adventurers life, they will face escalating challenges of ever increasing threat.

### Tiers of Adventure

| Adventuring Tier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 (fresh) | Basic adventuring tasks such as escorting travellers, gathering information, and performing simple errands. |
| 2 (capable) | More complex and challenging missions such as investigating strange occurrences, rescuing hostages, and battling small groups of foes. |
| 3 (experienced) | Difficult and dangerous adventures involving magical threats, overthrowing local forces, and slaying supernatural creatures. |
| 4 (seasoned) | High stakes missions such as penetrating enemy fortresses, exploring ancient ruins, and engaging in battles with powerful foes. |
| 5 (heroic) | Heroic deeds such as uncovering sinister conspiracies, facing powerful magical beings, and leading large-scale battles. |
| 6 (legendary)  | Epic quests that determine the fate of kingdoms and nations, such as stopping a massive invasion, overthrowing a tyrant, or preventing a cataclysmic event. |

### End of Gaming Session

At the end of a gaming session, each adventurer gains XP based on what they accomplished during that session.

If they were actively pursuing the adventure goal, they each gain 1 XP.

If they resolved an adventure during that gaming session, they each gain XP based on the difficulty of the adventure.

> “Adventures” below these difficulties are not considered actual adventures and therefore award no XP. Rescuing a cat from a tree is no adventure.
> 

| Difficulty | XP Reward |
| --- | --- |
| Risky (some risk of injuries or death, completed in one or two gaming sessions) | 2 XP |
| Dangerous (a very high risk of dying, completed over the course of several gaming sessions) | 3 XP |
| Epic (a miracle you made it through alive, completed over a large amount of gaming sessions) | 4 XP |

## Experience Points (XP)

In between adventurers, the group can spend their XP on different aspects of their characters during downtime. The group can decide on the length of their in-game downtime or the GM can set a limit until the next adventure awaits. Spending XP to improve something about your character also has to be explainable in the world of the characters. So improving a skill might require finding a mentor, or studying at some place.

While XP has to be spend upfront, you don‘t have to spend the required time all at once. So you can train over multiple downtimes to unlock a single improvement.

| **Improvement** | **XP Cost** |
| --- | --- |
| Improve Skill | 1 or more XP |
| Improve Attribute One Step | 4 XP |

## Learn New Skills

You start the game with a number of skills you already learned based on your upbringing and background. You can learn entirely new skills during downtime by spend time and coin. At the end of that time, you learn the new skill and can improve it with XP. You can only ever learn up to 12 skills.

### Improve Skills

Adventurers can learn and improve different skills. You start at rank 0 and with 0 XP for any skill you have learned. Skills you haven’t learned are treated as untrained for you. 

You can spend your XP, time, and coin to improve skills. Once you invest at least 2 XP in a skill, you are trained in that skill at rank 1. You can add that rank as a bonus to any rolls with the skill, and are able to learn rank 1 talents for that skill.

As you spend more XP, you advance your rank in that skill at certain thresholds. This increases your bonus on rolls, as well as your access to talents for that skill. You can never spend more than 30 XP in any single skill.

| Skill Rank | 0 (apprentice) | 1 (novice) | 2 (adept) | 3 (expert) | 4 (master) | 5 (grandmaster) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spend XP | 0-1 | 2-5 | 6-11 | 12-19 | 20-29 | 30 |

#### Optional Rule: XP Pacing

> With this, the maximum amount of XP you can spend in each individual skill is determined by the total amount of XP you have spend on all of your skills combined.
> 

If a group of adventurers prefers a more balanced approach to how much XP they can spend on individual skills, consider using this optional rule.

Using this rule enforces a wider spread of XP in many different skills without having one super advanced skill, while all others are much lower.

| Adventuring Tier | Tier 1 (fresh) | Tier 2 (capable) | Tier 3 (experienced) | Tier 4 (seasoned) | Tier 5 (heroic) | Tier 6 (legendary)  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Total XP Spend | ≥ 10 XP | 11-20 XP | 21-30 XP | 31-40 XP | 41-50 XP | 51+ XP |
| Max. XP per Skill | 4 XP each | 8 XP each | 12 XP each | 16 XP each | 20 XP each | 30 XP each |

### Learning Talents

> Every 2 XP in a skill unlocks a new talent or a new rank for an existing talent.
> 

Your spend XP in a skill determine how many talents you can learn for that skill (2 XP per talent rank). Choose any number of talents with a total XP cost up to the amount of spend XP in your skill and that are of equal or lower rank than your skill. Talents can be learned immediately during your training time when spending the XP for a skill. You can also hold onto your spend XP in a skill when you are saving up for a talent. You must first learn a lower rank of a talent before acquiring its next higher rank.
