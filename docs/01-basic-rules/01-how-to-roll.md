# üé≤ How To Roll

## Skill Tests

Most times you will pick up your dice to roll a Skill Test! Whenever the rules require you to ‚Äúmake a roll‚Äù or ‚Äúroll a test‚Äù, this is what it means.

> Roll your Attribute Die + 1d6 + Skill Rank and compare the result to the Target Number (8 per default). If you meet or beat it, you succeed!
> 

**Attribute Die:** Pick either Strength (STR), Agility (AGI), Spirit (SPI), or Mind (MND). Whatever fits the situation.

**Skill Rank:** If you have learned a skill that would help the situation, add your Rank in it to the roll.

**Target Number (TN):** Either picked by the GM based on the Difficulty, or determined by some game mechanic (e.g. an enemy‚Äôs Defense). If no other difficulty is mentioned for a roll, it is always moderate (8).

| Difficulty | TN | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Easy | 6 | convince an ally to help you out |
| Moderate | 8 | haggle with a merchant |
| Hard | 10 | notice the uneven stone tile which springs a trap |
| Very Hard | 12 | quickly leap over wet stones in a rushing river |
| Extremely Hard | 14 | bend iron bars with your bare hands |
| Nearly Impossible | 16 | hold the massive falling stone pillar from falling on your allies |

### Pass or Fail

The most basic of skill tasks for simple checks if any given action succeeds. You announce your intended action and the GM tells you the TN for that roll. If you meet or beat the TN with the result of their roll, you simply succeed.

### Success Levels

For when you not only need to know if you failed or succeeded, but how bad or well it went you can determine your Success Level relative to the TN you rolled against.

If you‚Ä¶

- roll 4 or more below the TN, you blundered.
- roll below the TN, you failed.
- roll the exact TN or one above it, you score a weak success.
- roll 2 or more above the TN, you score a strong success.
- roll 4 or more above the TN, you score a critical success.

| Difference to TN | Success Level (SL) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -4 or lower | Blunder | You fail horribly at your task. This situation gets worse or your failure has a major negative consequence. |
| -3 to -1 | Failure | You fail at your task and something bad happens as a result of it. |
| 0 to 1 | Weak | You barely succeed. In a stressful situation, your success might have some cost or consequence attached. |
| 2 to 3 | Strong | You succeed fully and convincingly. Without strings attached. |
| 4 or more | Critical | You succeed in the best way possible. Your success comes with positive side effects. |

> Note that failing or blundering a roll shouldn‚Äôt just mean that the adventurer is stuck in a situation - that‚Äôs never fun. Either something bad happens as a result of their roll and after they deal with the bad thing, they can try the roll again, OR something bad happens and the situation is resolved regardless, just in a disadvantageous way to the adventurer.

### Roll for Discovery

Use this kind of skill test whenever you want to attempt to gain knowledge about a situation, place, object, person, creature, or any other subject matter in the form of Discovery.

You can only roll for Discovery with expert skills you have learned.

You announce the subject you wish to gain Discovery for and the GM tells you the TN to do so.

**Weak.** You gain one Discovery.

**Strong.** You gain two Discovery.

**Critical.** You gain three Discovery.

For the rest of the scene, you can use one Discovery to make one assumption, observation, or ask the GM one closed question. The GM must answer if your assumption or observation is generally true or false, or answer your question with yes, no, or a short explanation.

When you or one of your allies act on an answer you got from spending Discovery, gain +1 boon on the roll. You can use all available Discovery for the rest of the scene, but not re-roll for Discovery about the same subject.

> See examples for what you can roll for Discovery about under ‚ÄúSkills‚Äù.
> 

### Boons and Banes

Whenever you're instructed to ‚Äúgain a boon‚Äù or ‚Äúsuffer a bane‚Äù in an effect, roll an additional 1d6 to your dice roll. If you're required to add both boons and banes, only roll extra d6s based on the difference between the two.

If you roll with boons, pick the highest result among the d6 for your roll and add it to your Attribute Die. Rolling with banes forces you to take the lowest result instead.

> Examples:
- Roll with +1 boon ‚Üí You roll your Attribute Die + 2d6 (take the highest d6) + Skill Rank.
- Roll with +1 bane ‚Üí You roll your Attribute Die + 2d6 (take the lowest d6) + Skill Rank.
- Roll with +1 boon and +1 bane ‚Üí You roll your Attribute Die + 1d6 (boon and bane cancel each other out) + Skill Rank.
- Roll with +2 boons and +1 bane ‚Üí You roll your Attribute Die + 2d6 (only one boon remains, take the highest d6) + Skill Rank.
- Roll with +1 boons and +2 bane ‚Üí You roll your Attribute Die + 2d6 (only one bane remains, take the lowest d6) + Skill Rank.

### Rolling for Untrained Skills

Without training, adventurers can only roll for general skills without penalties.

You suffer +1 bane on

- untrained combat skills
- untrained expert skills

You can‚Äôt attempt to roll

- untrained magic skills

### Re-rolling tests

Some abilities allow you to re-roll certain tests. When choosing to do so, you must take the result of the new roll.

## Dice Checks

Dice Checks are all dice rolls which aren‚Äôt considered skill tests and are referenced as ‚Äúchecks‚Äù in the rules. Dice Checks normally include a single die against a static TN. Anytime the rules ask you to make a check of some kind (i.e. Durability or Supply), you roll the associated die and compare the result to the possible outcomes for that kind of check.

### Durability Checks

You must roll a Durability check, when some item you are wearing, carrying, or wielding is at the risk of being damaged. Each item has a corresponding Durability die based on it‚Äôs material or size. If nothing else is mentioned for an item, it is always assumed to have a d6 Durability die.

If you roll a 1 or a 2 with your Durability check, a normal item get‚Äôs damaged or an already damaged item becomes destroyed. For more details, see the Weapon & Armor Properties section. You can attempt to repair damaged or destroyed items, as described in the Downtime section.

### Supply Checks

Your Supplies are general stocks of useful items, such as provisions, light sources, or common materials. Whenever you have to make a Supply check, the die depends on how much Supply of that kind you have left. If you roll a 1 or a 2, the Supply‚Äôs die size decreases by one step or you use up all of your remaining Supply, if it already was at a d4. See more under Supply in the Items section.

### Individual Checks

Some checks don‚Äôt require a target number to succeed, but instead have different outcomes based on the result. For example, you roll a d6 when **frightened**. On a 1, you cower in fear and can‚Äôt act or move. On a 2-5, you simply run away from the source of your fear. On a 6, you can act normally, but suffer a bane on all skill rolls.
