## Skill Tests

Most times you will pick up your dice to roll a Skill Test. Whenever the rules require you to "make a roll" or "roll a test," this is what it means.

> Roll your Attribute Die + 1d6 + Skill Rank and compare the result to the Target Number (8 by default). If you meet or beat it, you succeed!
> 

**Attribute Die:** Choose either Strength (STR), Agility (AGI), Spirit (SPI), or Mind (MND), depending on what best fits the situation.

**Skill Rank:** If you have learned a skill that would help in the situation, add your Rank in that skill to the roll.

**Target Number (TN):** Either determined by the Game Master (GM) based on the Difficulty or set by a game mechanic (such as an enemy's Defense). If no specific difficulty is mentioned for a roll, it is always Medium (8).

| Difficulty | TN | Examples by Attribute |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trivial* | 4 | **STR:** Push open a stuck door<br>**AGI:** Hop over a small stream<br>**SPI:** Sense obvious deception<br>**MND:** Recall common knowledge |
| Easy | 6 | **STR:** Lift a heavy sack<br>**AGI:** Balance on a wide beam<br>**SPI:** Sense someone's mood<br>**MND:** Remember local customs |
| Medium | 8 | **STR:** Climb a rough cliff<br>**AGI:** Dance through a crowded bazaar<br>**SPI:** Spot a hidden scorpion<br>**MND:** Identify a valuable gemstone |
| Hard | 10 | **STR:** Bend iron bars<br>**AGI:** Navigate a narrow ledge<br>**SPI:** Resist a minor curse<br>**MND:** Translate an ancient dialect |
| Very Hard | 12 | **STR:** Lift a boulder<br>**AGI:** Catch an arrow mid-flight<br>**SPI:** Calm a raging beast<br>**MND:** Decipher complex hieroglyphs |
| Extreme | 14 | **STR:** Uproot a palm tree<br>**AGI:** Dodge multiple spear thrusts<br>**SPI:** Sense an approaching sandstorm<br>**MND:** Understand forgotten ritual magic |
| Legendary | 16 | **STR:** Topple a stone obelisk<br>**AGI:** Perform impossible acrobatics<br>**SPI:** Commune with ancestral spirits<br>**MND:** Master a lost magical language |

** Unless you are particularly unskilled at the given task, you automatically succeed on Trivial tasks.*

### Pass or Fail

The most basic skill tests determine if an action simply succeeds or fails. You announce your intended action, and the GM tells you the Target Number. If you meet or beat the TN with your roll, you succeed.

> Sansar the Thief attempts to pick a lock on an ornate chest. The GM determines this is a Medium difficulty task (TN 8). Sansar rolls their AGI die (d8) + 1d6 + their Stealth skill rank of 2. The roll results in a 6 + 3 + 2 getting a total of 11. This exceeds the TN of 8, so Sansar successfully opens the chest.
> 

### Success Levels

Sometimes you need to know not just whether you succeeded or failed, but by how much. Success Levels determine the quality of your result relative to the Target Number.

If you...

- Roll 6 or more below the TN, you suffer a **Blunder**.
- Roll below the TN, you **Fail**.
- Roll the exact TN or up to 2 above it, you achieve a **Weak Success**.
- Roll 3-5 above the TN, you achieve a **Strong Success**.
- Roll 6 or more above the TN, you achieve a **Critical Success**.

| Difference to TN | Success Level (SL) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -6 or lower | Blunder | You fail catastrophically. The situation worsens significantly or your failure has major negative consequences. |
| -5 to -1 | Failure | You fail at your task and face some negative consequence as a result. |
| 0 to 2 | Weak Success | You barely succeed. In challenging situations, your success might come with some cost or consequence. |
| 3 to 5 | Strong Success | You succeed completely without complications. |
| 6 or more | Critical Success | You succeed brilliantly. Your success brings additional positive effects. |

> Arzhag the Warrior attempts to climb the crumbling temple wall during a sandstorm, a Very Hard task (TN 12). They roll their Strength die (d10) + 1d6 + Athletics 3, for a total of 15. This is 3 above the TN, earning a Strong Success. Arzhag scales the wall efficiently despite the harsh conditions.
> 

> Remember: A failed roll should never simply halt progress. Either a negative consequence occurs that the adventurer must address before trying again, or the situation resolves in a way that's disadvantageous but allows the story to continue.
> 

### Boons and Banes

Certain situations grant you boons (advantages) or inflict banes (disadvantages) on your rolls. When instructed to "gain +1 boon" or "suffer +1 bane," roll an additional 1d6 for your test. When both boons and banes apply, they cancel each other out one-for-one.

With boons, you roll 2d6 and use the **higher** result along with your Attribute Die. With banes, you must use the **lower** result of the 2d6.

Multiple boons or banes beyond the first add a +1 bonus or -1 penalty to your roll, respectively.

| Roll Condition | How to Roll |
| --- | --- |
| +1 boon | Attribute Die + 2d6 (take highest d6) + Skill Rank |
| +1 bane | Attribute Die + 2d6 (take lowest d6) + Skill Rank |
| +1 boon & +1 bane | Attribute Die + 1d6 + Skill Rank (they cancel out) |
| +2 boons & +1 bane | Attribute Die + 2d6 (take highest d6) + Skill Rank + 1 |
| +1 boon & +2 banes | Attribute Die + 2d6 (take lowest d6) + Skill Rank - 1 |

> Nagkhan the Sorcerer attempts to identify a mysterious artifact using their Arcana skill. Due to poor lighting in the ancient tomb, they suffer +1 bane. However, they previously consulted relevant texts, granting +1 boon. The boon and bane cancel each other out, so Nagkhan rolls normally: Mind + 1d6 + Arcana rank.
> 

### Rolling for Untrained Skills

Adventurers can attempt general skills without training and without penalty. However, specialized skills impose limitations when untrained:

- **No Penalty:** General skills (Perception, Athletics, Influence, etc.)
- **+1 Bane:** Untrained combat skills (Fighting, Archery)
- **+1 Bane:** Untrained expert skills (Lore, Crafting, Survival)
- **Cannot Attempt:** Untrained magic skills (Arcana, Mysticism)

> When Arzhag the Warrior tries to identify medicinal plants in the oasis, they roll with Nature. Being untrained in this expert skill, they suffer +1 bane on their roll. Meanwhile, Sephi the Seer, when attempting to endure a scorching desert journey using Fortitude (a general skill), rolls without penalty despite being untrained.
> 

### Re-rolling Tests

Some abilities, blessings, or magical effects allow you to re-roll certain tests. When choosing to do so, you must accept the result of the new roll, even if it's worse than your original result.

> Blessed by Neiru's wisdom before a critical challenge, Sephi the Seer uses one of their Resolve to re-roll one Mind test. When trying to decipher ancient hieroglyphs and rolling poorly, they invoke this blessing for a second chance, but must accept whatever new result the dice show.
> 

## Dice Checks

Dice Checks differ from Skill Tests and are referenced simply as “checks” in the rules. These typically involve rolling a single die and interpreting the result based on the type of check. When the rules call for a check (such as **Durability** or **Supply**), roll the appropriate die and follow the outcome guidelines for that check.

### Durability Checks

When an item you are wearing, carrying, or wielding is at risk of damage, the GM may call for a **Durability check**. Each item has a **Durability die** based on its construction and material (see *Item Durability* in the Items section).

To make a Durability check, roll the item’s Durability die:

- On a **1–3**, **spend 1 use** for the item
- On a **4+**, nothing happens—the item holds up

If you lose the **third and final use**, the item becomes **damaged** (with reduced effectiveness, detailed under Weapon and Armor Properties). If you lose another use while the item is damaged, it becomes **broken** and unusable until repaired.

> Example:
> 
> 
> Arzhag’s bronze shield is struck by a golem. It’s a heavy metal item, so he rolls a **d8**. The result is a **2**—within the failure range—so the shield loses 1 use.
> 

### Supply Checks

Supplies are treated like bundled items (rations, torches, arrows, crafting materials, etc.). Each supply has **3 uses**.

To make a Supply check, roll the supply's **Durability die**, typically based on the bundle type (usually **d6**, but could vary by quality or scarcity):

- On a **1–3**, **spend 1 use** for your supply
- On a **4+**, no relevant change in your supply

When all 3 uses are spent, that supply is **depleted**.

> Example:
> 
> 
> Sansar is running low on rations. After a day in the wilderness, the GM calls for a Supply Check. Their rations use a **d6** Durability die. Sansar rolls a **2**, spending 1 of the 3 uses. If all are spent, they’ll be out of food.
> 

### Individual Checks

Some situations call for unique checks that don’t involve a TN but instead have varying effects based on the die result. These are referred to as **individual checks** and will define their own consequences (e.g. Fear or Confusion Checks).

> Example:
> 
> 
> When exposed to the terrifying form of Nakesh, Nagkhan must roll a **d6** Fear Check:
> 
> • On a **1**, they freeze in fear and can’t act
> 
> • On **2–5**, they flee in panic
> 
> • On a **6**, they act normally but suffer **+1 bane** on all rolls involving their fears
>
