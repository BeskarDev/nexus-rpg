# üé≤ How To Roll

![banner-img](/img/banner/how-to-roll-banner.png)

## Skill Tests

Most times you will pick up your dice to roll a Skill Test! Whenever the rules require you to ‚Äúmake a roll‚Äù or ‚Äúroll a test‚Äù, this is what it means.

> Roll your Attribute Die + 1d6 + Skill Rank and compare the result to the Target Number (8 per default). If you meet or beat it, you succeed!
> 

**Attribute Die:** Pick either Strength (STR), Agility (AGI), Spirit (SPI), or Mind (MND). Whatever fits the situation.

**Skill Rank:** If you have learned a skill that would help the situation, add your Rank in it to the roll.

**Target Number (TN):** Either picked by the GM based on the Difficulty or determined by some game mechanic (e.g. an enemy‚Äôs Defense). If no other difficulty is mentioned for a roll, it is always medium (8).

| Difficulty | TN | Examples (Strength, Agility, Spirit, Mind) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trivial* | 4 | push open a stuck window, hop over a stream, recognize a common plant, remember a basic fact |
| Easy | 6 | jump over a small hole in the floor, dodge a thrown rock, sense someone‚Äôs mood, recount a local folktale |
| Medium | 8 | climb a rough cliff face, perform a complex dance, notice a hidden predator at night, understand the cause of natural phenomenon |
| Hard | 10 | climb a rough cliff face barehanded, perform a complex dance, notice a hidden predator at night, decipher a coded message |
| Very Hard | 12 | lift a boulder, precisely land on a narrow ledge, calm a ferocious beast, understand a complex mechanism |
| Extreme | 14 | uproot a tree, dodge a barrage of arrows, intuitively sense an approaching ambush, understand the workings of an otherworldly portal |
| Legendary | 16 | topple a huge stone statue, perform a gravity-defying acrobatic feat, predict an impending natural disaster, decipher an ancient forgotten language |

** unless you are very bad at the given task, it is automatically assumed that you can succeed on trivial tasks.*

### Pass or Fail

The most basic of skill tasks for simple checks if any given action succeeds. You announce your intended action and the GM tells you the TN for that roll. If you meet or beat the TN with the result of their roll, you simply succeed.

### Success Levels

For when you not only need to know if you failed or succeeded but how bad or well it went you can determine your Success Level relative to the TN you rolled against.

If you‚Ä¶

- roll 6 or more below the TN, you blundered.
- roll below the TN, you failed.
- roll the exact TN or one above it, you score a weak success.
- roll 3 or more above the TN, you score a strong success.
- roll 6 or more above the TN, you score a critical success.

> For example, you roll a test against a medium difficulty of 8. If you roll a 8, 9, or 10, it is a weak success. An 11, 12, or 13 would be a strong success and a 14 or higher would be a critical success.
> 

| Difference to TN | Success Level (SL) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -6 or lower | Blunder | You fail horribly at your task. This situation gets worse or your failure has a major negative consequence. |
| -5 to -1 | Failure | You fail at your task and something bad happens as a result of it. |
| 0 to 2 | Weak | You barely succeed. In a stressful situation, your success might have some cost or consequence attached. |
| 3 to 5 | Strong | You succeed fully and without strings attached. |
| 6 or more | Critical | You succeed in the best way possible. Your success comes with positive side effects. |

> Note that failing or blundering a roll shouldn‚Äôt just mean that the adventurer is stuck in a situation - that‚Äôs never fun. Either something bad happens as a result of their roll and after they deal with the bad thing, they can try the roll again, OR something bad happens and the situation is resolved regardless, just in a disadvantageous way to the adventurer.

### Boons and Banes

Whenever you're instructed to ‚Äúgain a boon‚Äù or ‚Äúsuffer a bane‚Äù in an effect, roll an additional 1d6 to your dice roll. If you're required to add both boons and banes, cancel them out one to one and only roll an extra 1d6 if any boons or banes remain. 

If you roll with boons, pick the highest result among the 2d6 for your roll and add it to your Attribute Die. Rolling with banes forces you to take the lowest result instead.

If you would ever benefit from. two or more boons or suffer two or more banes, you still roll with 2d6 and pick one of the results, but you also gain a +1 bonus for boons or - 1 penalty of banes beyond the first. 

> There exist the following cases of rolling with boons and/or banes.
- Roll with +1 boon ‚Üí You roll your Attribute Die + 2d6 (take the highest of the two d6) + Skill Rank.
- Roll with +1 bane ‚Üí You roll your Attribute Die + 2d6 (take the lowest of the two d6) + Skill Rank.
- Roll with +1 boon and +1 bane ‚Üí You roll your Attribute Die + 1d6 (boon and bane cancel each other out) + Skill Rank.
- Roll with +2 boons and +1 bane ‚Üí You roll your Attribute Die + 2d6 (only one boon remains, take the highest of the two d6) + Skill Rank.
- Roll with +1 boons and +2 bane ‚Üí You roll your Attribute Die + 2d6 (only one bane remains, take the lowest of the two d6) + Skill Rank.
> 

### Rolling for Untrained Skills

Without training, adventurers can only roll for general skills without penalties.

You suffer +1 bane on

- untrained combat skills
- untrained expert skills

You can‚Äôt attempt to roll

- untrained magic skills

> For example, rolling Fortitude to withstand the scorching sun while traveling through the desert, without having that skill trained, doesn‚Äôt impose any penalties. Meanwhile, rolling Nature to understand the properties of some ominous plant in the wild imposes +1 bane on the roll if untrained.
> 

### Re-rolling tests

Some abilities allow you to re-roll certain tests. When choosing to do so, you must take the result of the new roll.

## Dice Checks

Dice Checks are all dice rolls that aren‚Äôt considered skill tests and are referenced as ‚Äúchecks‚Äù in the rules. Dice Checks normally include a single die against a static TN. Anytime the rules ask you to make a check of some kind (i.e. Durability or Supply), you roll the associated die and compare the result to the possible outcomes for that kind of check.

### Durability Checks

You must roll a Durability check, when some item you are wearing, carrying, or wielding is at the risk of being damaged. Each item has a corresponding Durability die based on its material or size (see Item Durability for more details).

### Supply Checks

Your supplies are general stocks of useful items, such as rations, light sources, or crafting materials. Whenever you have to make a Supply check, the die depends on how much Supply of that kind you have left. If you roll a 1 or a 2, the Supply‚Äôs die size decreases by one step or you use up all of your remaining Supply, if you only had 1 left. See more under Supply in the Items section.

### Individual Checks

Some checks don‚Äôt require a target number to succeed but instead have different outcomes based on the result. For example, you roll a d6 when **frightened**. On a 1, you cower in fear and can‚Äôt act or move. On a 2-5, you simply run away from the source of your fear. On a 6, you can act normally, but suffer a bane on all skill rolls.
