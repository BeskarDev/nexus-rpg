# 🎲 How To Roll

## Skill Tests

Most times you will pick up your dice to roll a Skill Test! Whenever the rules require you to “make a roll” or “roll a test”, this is what it means.

> Roll your Attribute Die + 1d6 + Skill Rank and compare the result to the Target Number (8 per default). If you meet or beat it, you succeed!
> 

**Attribute Die:** Pick either Strength (STR), Agility (AGI), Spirit (SPI), or Mind (MND). Whatever fits the situation.

**Skill Rank:** If you have learned a skill that would help the situation, add your Rank in it to the roll.

**Target Number (TN):** Either picked by the GM based on the Difficulty, or determined by some game mechanic (e.g. an enemy’s Defense). If no other difficulty is mentioned for a roll, it is always moderate (8).

| Difficulty | TN | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Easy | 6 | convince an ally to help you out |
| Moderate | 8 | haggle with a merchant |
| Hard | 10 | notice the uneven stone tile which springs a trap |
| Very Hard | 12 | quickly leap over wet stones in a rushing river |
| Extremely Hard | 14 | bend iron bars with your bare hands |
| Nearly Impossible | 16 | hold the massive falling stone pillar from falling on your allies |

### Pass or Fail

The most basic of skill tasks for simple checks if any given action succeeds. You announce your intended action and the GM tells you the TN for that roll. If you meet or beat the TN with the result of their roll, you simply succeed.

### Success Levels

For when you not only need to know if you failed or succeeded, but how bad or well it went you can determine your Success Level relative to the TN you rolled against.

If you…

- roll 4 or more below the TN, you blundered.
- roll below the TN, you failed.
- roll the exact TN or one above it, you score a weak success.
- roll 2 or more above the TN, you score a strong success.
- roll 4 or more above the TN, you score a critical success.

| Difference to TN | Success Level (SL) | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -4 or lower | Blunder | You fail horribly at your task. This situation gets worse or your failure has a major negative consequence. |
| -3 to -1 | Failure | You fail at your task and something bad happens as a result of it. |
| 0 to 1 | Weak | You barely succeed. In a stressful situation, your success might have some cost or consequence attached. |
| 2 to 3 | Strong | You succeed fully and convincingly. Without strings attached. |
| 4 or more | Critical | You succeed in the best way possible. Your success comes with positive side effects. |

> Note that failing or blundering a roll shouldn’t just mean that the adventurer is stuck in a situation - that’s never fun. Either something bad happens as a result of their roll and after they deal with the bad thing, they can try the roll again, OR something bad happens and the situation is resolved regardless, just in a disadvantageous way to the adventurer.

### Roll for Discovery

Use this kind of skill test whenever you want to attempt to gain knowledge about a situation, place, object, person, creature, or any other subject matter in the form of Discovery.

You can only roll for Discovery with expert skills you have learned.

You announce the subject you wish to gain Discovery for and the GM tells you the TN to do so.

**Weak.** You gain one Discovery.

**Strong.** You gain two Discovery.

**Critical.** You gain three Discovery.

For the rest of the scene, you can use one Discovery to make one assumption, observation, or ask the GM one closed question. The GM must answer if your assumption or observation is generally true or false, or answer your question with yes, no, or a short explanation.

When you or one of your allies act on an answer you got from spending Discovery, gain +1 boon on the roll. You can use all available Discovery for the rest of the scene, but not re-roll for Discovery about the same subject.

> See examples for what you can roll for Discovery about under “Skills”.
> 

### Boons and Banes

Whenever an effect asks you to “gain a boon” or “suffer a bane”, add another 1d6 to your roll. If you would add both boons and banes to a roll, cancel them out one by one before rolling.

If you roll with boons, pick the highest result among the d6 for your roll and add it to your Attribute Die. Rolling with banes forces you to take the lowest result instead.

### Rolling for Untrained Skills

Without training, adventurers can only roll for general skills without penalties.

You suffer +1 bane on

- untrained combat skills
- untrained expert skills

You can’t attempt to roll

- untrained magic skills

### Re-rolling tests

Some abilities allow you to re-roll certain tests. When choosing to do so, you must take the result of the new roll.

## Dice Checks

Dice Checks are all dice rolls, which aren’t considered skill tests and are referenced as “checks” in the rules. Dice Checks normally include a single die against a static TN.

For example, you must succeed on a Durability check when your weapon is about to be damaged. You roll your weapons durability die (d6 for a mundane weapon). On a 3+, your weapon doesn’t get damaged.

Some checks don’t require a target number to succeed, but instead have different outcomes based on the result. For example, you roll a d6 when **frightened**. On a 1, you cower in fear and can’t act or move. On a 2-5, you simply run away from the source of your fear. On a 6, you can act normally, but suffer a bane on all skill rolls.
