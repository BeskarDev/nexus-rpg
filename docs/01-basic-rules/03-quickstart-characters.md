> "The greatest warriors were once novices with nothing but determination and a well-chosen path."
>


## Using These Examples

These quickstart characters demonstrate classic fantasy archetypes within Nexus RPG. Each example follows the standard character creation rules:

- **Starting XP:** 6 XP total (3 skills at rank 1 with 2 XP each, 4 skills at rank 0)
- **Starting Coins:** 350 coins for equipment (plus 10 unspendable coins)
- **Standard Gear:** Backpack, 2 pouches, traveler's clothes, hemp rope (1 load), camping kit (1 load), toolkit (1 load), rations d4 (1 load), torches d4 (1 load)
  - If an archetype lists a specific toolkit, it's the one from Standard Gear: it costs 0 extra coins and its load is already counted in the 5-load Standard Gear.

Each archetype includes recommended attributes, skill selections with talent choices, upbringing and background, equipment purchases within the 350 coin budget, and playstyle descriptions.

Feel free to customize these examples to match your vision or use them as-is for quick character creation.

**Playstyle & Advancement**

The Apothecary rewards patience, setup, and smart resource use.

Field Medic makes you the teamâ€™s onâ€‘site healer for stabilizing and treating injuries. Use Aimed Shot to land reliable first strikes and Precise Shot to punch through armor when needed.

**Advancement:** Raise Archery 2â€“3 for more Combat Arts and consistency (Sharpshooter or Rapid Shot next).
