![banner-img](/img/banner/character-creation-banner.png)

> "The greatest warriors were once novices with nothing but determination and a well-chosen path."
>


## Using These Examples

These quickstart characters demonstrate classic fantasy archetypes within Nexus RPG. Each example follows the standard character creation rules:

- **Starting XP:** 6 XP total (3 skills at rank 1 with 2 XP each, 4 skills at rank 0)
- **Starting Coins:** 350 coins for equipment (plus 10 unspendable coins)
- **Standard Gear:** Backpack, 2 pouches, traveler's clothes, hemp rope (1 load), camping kit (1 load), toolkit (1 load), rations d4 (1 load), torches d4 (1 load)
  - If an archetype lists a specific toolkit, it's the one from Standard Gear: it costs 0 extra coins and its load is already counted in the 5-load Standard Gear.

Each archetype includes recommended attributes, skill selections with talent choices, upbringing and background, equipment purchases within the 350 coin budget, and playstyle descriptions.

Feel free to customize these examples to match your vision or use them as-is for quick character creation.

|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| d4  | d8  | d6  | d6  |

**Upbringing & Background**

- **Background:** Apothecary (Crafting, Education, Insight, Nature)
- **Starting Item:** Rare herb bundle (0 load)

**Rank 1 Skills:**

- **Nature** â€“ *Field Medic (Rank 1)* â€“ Better stabilize/treat injuries, quick battlefield care

**Rank 0 Skills:** Lore â€ , Perception, Insight, Education

Note: â€  Customized skill (not from upbringing/background suggestions)

**Combat Arts**

As an Archery rank 1 character, you know **2 Combat Arts** for ranged weapons. Recommended for a blowpipe user:

- **Aimed Shot** â€“ Gain +1 boon when you donâ€™t move
- **Precise Shot** â€“ Ignore armor and add Agility to damage

**Equipment**

- Blowpipe (25 coins, 1 load)
- Blowdarts d8 (5 coins, 1 load)
- Leather Armor (50 coins, 1 load)

- **Total Load:** 10 (equipment 5 + standard gear 5)
- **Carry Capacity:** 10 (1/2 STR 2 + 8)
- **Remaining Coins:** 190

**Playstyle & Advancement**

The Apothecary rewards patience, setup, and smart resource use. Open from stealth with the silent blowpipe; coat darts with Weapon Poison and use the blowpipe property to multiply the poisonâ€™s damage on strong/critical hits. Peak Performance lets you boost your darts (ammo) for +2 damage the whole day, turning small hits into meaningful chip. Field Medic makes you the teamâ€™s onâ€‘site healer for stabilizing and treating injuries. Use Aimed Shot to land reliable first strikes and Precise Shot to punch through armor when needed.

**Advancement:** Raise Archery 2â€“3 for more Combat Arts and consistency (Sharpshooter or Rapid Shot next). Push Nature 2â€“3 to deepen triage and wilderness sourcing, and Crafting 2â€“3 for stronger prep (Efficient Worker, Artisan, or Peak Performance 2).

**Focus Pool:** (Spirit-2) + (2Ã—Mysticism) = 6 + 2 = 8

**Starting Spells (2 from two traditions at rank 0-1):**

The Bard shines in social scenes and soft control. Use performanceâ€‘flavored rank 0 spells with Master of Principles to land key effects reliably; Calming Influence and veils shape tempo before blades are drawn. Inspire Ally fuels alliesâ€™ key rolls (and damage), while Eloquent Talker keeps you dominant in parley. You can still carry a shortsword, but your magic and words are your real weapons.

**Animal Companion**

Use the companion base stat block with Tier equal to your Nature rank (see the Mounts & Companions rules). Then pick any one Animal trait to define your companionâ€™s type.

Suggested traits:

- Dog â€” Loyal tracker with pack tactics and reliable grapples.
- Cat â€” Stealthy scout with pounce and knockdown.
- Boar â€” Durable frontline that can gore on a charge.

**Playstyle & Advancement**

The Tamer locks lanes and creates openings for their animal. Use Fast Stride to kite; Disarm to strip threats; Snare to pin priority targets so your companion can maul them. Pugilist improves your baseline brawl control with whips and grapples. Your companion is your second bodyâ€”set up flanks and force bad choices.

**Advancement:** Raise Nature 2â€“3 to deepen companion options; Fighting 2â€“3 for more Combat Arts (Supreme Disarm, Flurry). Add Athletics or Survival for mobility and fieldcraft. Consider Field Medic from Nature for downtime care.
