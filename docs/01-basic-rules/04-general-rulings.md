# ℹ️ General Rulings

![banner-img](/img/banner/rulings-banner.png)

## Rounding Decimals

Whenever you divide some number and end up with an decimal fraction, round down to the nearest integer unless the rule says otherwise.

## Stacking multiple bonuses

When having talents, abilities, spells, enchantments, etc. applying bonuses to your character’s statistics or to items you are wearing, you need to consider whether they will all apply at the same time or if they won’t. When a bonus, such as “gain +1 Parry” doesn’t specify which category of bonus it is, it will stack with other similar bonuses. But an effect “gain +1 Parry (skill bonus)” will not stack with another effect granting Parry as a skill bonus. The same rule applies to bonuses (temporary and permanent) affecting equipment. So if your weapon would gain “increase the weapon damage by 1 (enhancement bonus)” multiple times, one one of those bonuses would apply. If multiple bonuses would not stack with each other and they differ in value, choose the highest one among them.
