# ⭐ Character Progression

![banner-img](/img/banner/character-progression-banner.png)

## Experience Points (XP)

You gain XP through playing sessions, which you can then invest in your character's skills during downtime periods. The base XP gain is 1 XP per session (roughly 3-4 hours of game time).

You can earn 2 XP instead of 1 when you achieve significant milestones during a session:

- Defeating a powerful adversary
- Discovering valuable treasure
- Uncovering a well-protected secret

> During a session, your party defeats a fearsome dragon guarding an ancient vault. You earn 2 XP instead of 1 for this significant achievement.
> 

## Spending XP on Skills

During downtime periods, you can invest your earned XP into skills. The rate at which you can spend XP depends on your chosen downtime activity. Your Character Level determines the maximum XP you can invest in any single skill.

- Active training allows you to spend up to 4 XP per week
- Other downtime activities allow you to spend 2 XP per week on a certain selection of skills
- You can also learn entirely new skills, which start at 0 XP

> At Character Level 3, you can spend up to 6 XP in any single skill. If you have 8 XP available and spend a week actively training, you could invest 4 XP into your Fighting skill, bringing it from 2 XP to 6 XP.

### Skill Ranks

As you invest XP in a skill, it increases in rank at specific thresholds:

| Skill Rank | 0 (apprentice) | 1 (novice) | 2 (adept) | 3 (expert) | 4 (master) | 5 (grandmaster) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| XP Requirement | 0 | 2 | 6 | 12 | 18 | 24 |

> You have 6 XP in your Stealth skill. This puts you at rank 2. You'll need to invest 6 more XP to reach the next threshold of 12 XP for rank 3.
> 

## Character Level

Your Character Level advances automatically when your total spent XP reaches specific thresholds. Important notes:

- Only XP actually spent in skills counts toward level progression
- Each level grants specific bonuses to your character's capabilities
- Higher levels allow you to invest more XP in individual skills

| **10** (Legendary) | 90 | 28 XP (Rank 5) | +2 HP, +1d on one Attribute (max. d12) |

> You've spent 18 XP across various skills. This puts you at Character Level 3 (Capable), which means you can now invest up to 6 XP in any single skill and you've gained +4 HP, one Attribute increase, and +1 on all Defenses since starting.

## Talent Points (TP)

Talent Points represent your character's specialized abilities within each skill.

- You earn 1 TP for every 2 XP invested in a skill
- You can spend 1 TP to:
    - Learn a new talent for that skill at rank 1
    - Increase the rank of an existing talent (maximum rank equals the skill's rank)

> You have invested 6 XP in your Arcana skill, which gives you 3 TP to spend. You could use these points to learn two new talents at rank 1 and increase another talent from rank 1 to rank 2, using all 3 TP.
