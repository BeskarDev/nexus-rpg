# Bard



Role: Support / Controller

Note: † Customized skill (not from upbringing/background suggestions)

**Equipment**

- Shortsword (50 coins, 1 load)
- Spell Catalyst (Mystic Talisman) (75 coins, 0 load)
- Musical Instrument toolkit (included in standard gear)
- **Total Load:** 6 (equipment 1 + standard gear 5)
- **Carry Capacity:** 10 (1/2 STR 2 + 8)
- **Remaining Coins:** 225

**Spells**

**Tradition:** Twilight (illusion/dreams) and Peace (calming/travel) — using Balance (two traditions; freely choose spells from either)
**Focus Pool:** (Spirit-2) + (2×Mysticism) = 6 + 2 = 8

**Starting Spells (2 from two traditions at rank 0-1):**

- **Rank 0:** Obscuring Veil (Twilight), Calming Influence (Peace)
- **Rank 1:** Cloak of Night (Twilight), Blessing of Peace (Peace)

Note: At rank 1, you know 4 total spells: 2 starting + 2 from gaining rank 1

**Animal Companion**

If you choose Animal Companion, use the companion base stat block with Tier equal to your Nature rank (see the Mounts & Companions rules). Then pick any one Animal trait to define your companion’s type.

Suggested traits:

- Bear — Tough frontline with knockdown/grapple options and an intimidating roar.
- Bird — Fast flying scout with keen eyes and dive attack bursts.
- Constrictor Snake — Grapple and restrain to lock down priority targets.

**Playstyle & Advancement**

The Bard shines in social scenes and soft control. Use performance‑flavored rank 0 spells with Master of Principles to land key effects reliably; Calming Influence and veils shape tempo before blades are drawn. Inspire Ally fuels allies’ key rolls (and damage), while Eloquent Talker keeps you dominant in parley. You can still carry a shortsword, but your magic and words are your real weapons.

**Advancement:** Raise Mysticism 2–3 to expand spells and reliability (Communal Practices next if you want multi‑target flexibility). Boost Influence 2–3 for stronger team support (Leading Presence is a great pick). Add Education/Lore for cultural/magical knowledge, and optionally Stealth for infiltration and stagecraft.
