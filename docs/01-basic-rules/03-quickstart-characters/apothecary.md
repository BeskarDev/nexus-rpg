As an Archery rank 1 character, you know **2 Combat Arts** for ranged weapons. Recommended for a blowpipe user:

- **Precise Shot** – Ignore armor and add Agility to damage

**Equipment**

**Playstyle & Advancement**

The Apothecary rewards patience, setup, and smart resource use. Open from stealth with the silent blowpipe; coat darts with Weapon Poison and use the blowpipe property to multiply the poison’s damage on strong/critical hits. Peak Performance lets you boost your darts (ammo) for +2 damage the whole day, turning small hits into meaningful chip. Field Medic makes you the team’s on‑site healer for stabilizing and treating injuries. Use Aimed Shot to land reliable first strikes and Precise Shot to punch through armor when needed.

**Advancement:** Raise Archery 2–3 for more Combat Arts and consistency (Sharpshooter or Rapid Shot next). Push Nature 2–3 to deepen triage and wilderness sourcing, and Crafting 2–3 for stronger prep (Efficient Worker, Artisan, or Peak Performance 2). Add Lore for formula lore and Education for scholarly support. Consider Stealth later to exploit blowpipe ambushes with Assassination synergy.
