Use mind control, curses, and drain effects to control enemies. Piercing Look helps you understand and manipulate others. Master of Fundamentals ensures your rank 0 spells remain reliable.

**Advancement:** Increase Arcana to rank 2-3 for more powerful spells and additional spells known, raise Lore for deeper occult knowledge, add Fortitude for resilience against backlash, and consider Spellweaver for Metamagic Arts.
