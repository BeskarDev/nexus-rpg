**Combat Arts**

As a Fighting rank 1 character, you know **2 Combat Arts** for melee weapons. Recommended:

- **Cleave** – Hit multiple enemies with your greataxe

**Equipment**

- Greataxe (150 coins, 2 load)

**Playstyle & Advancement**

The Barbarian is perfect for players who want to deal massive damage and play aggressively, accepting risk for reward. Battle Rage provides combat bonuses while Heavy Weapon Mastery makes Brutal Strike attacks deadly without suffering banes. Bulky gives you extra HP to survive when rage runs out. Avoid heavy armor to maintain rage effectiveness. Use Cleave to hit multiple foes and Brutal Strike for single-target devastation.

**Advancement:** Increase Battle Rage ranks for greater power, raise Fighting and Fortitude to rank 2-3 for more Combat Arts and resilience, add Survival for wilderness expertise, and consider Hard to Kill for survivability.
