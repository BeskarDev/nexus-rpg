**Spells**

Discipline: Conjuration (summoning/glyphs)
Focus Pool: (Mind-2) + (2×Arcana) = 6 + 2 = 8

Starting Spells (choose Conjuration; take 2 rank 0 + 2 rank 1):

- Rank 0: Arcane Bolt, Arcane Glyph
- Rank 1: Arcane Barrier, Conjure Familiar

Note: At rank 1, you know 4 total Conjuration spells.

**Familiar**

If you prepare Conjure Familiar, build your familiar as a Tier 0 companion (see the Mounts & Companions rules). Then pick any one Animal trait to define your familiar’s form and role.

Suggested traits:

- Raven — Flying scout with great perception and mobility.
- Cat — Stealthy skirmisher for cramped spaces.
- Spider — Web control once per scene for restraint.

**Playstyle & Advancement**

The Summoner controls tempo with glyphs and durable constructs while adding bodies to the field. Use Arcane Glyph for traps and Arcane Barrier for cover and lanes. Master of Fundamentals keeps cantrips reliable. Conjure Familiar gives you a versatile scout and support ally early; later, Summon Aberration adds real battlefield presence.

Advancement: Raise Arcana 2–3 for more spells and Focus; consider Inexhaustible Mind or Spellweaver. Add Lore for arcane theory and Insight for reading foes. After your familiar, look to Summon Aberration and utility control like Arcane Eye.
