# 🎭 Quickstart Characters

![banner-img](/img/banner/character-creation-banner.png)

> "The greatest warriors were once novices with nothing but determination and a well-chosen path."

## Using These Examples

These quickstart characters demonstrate classic fantasy archetypes within Nexus RPG. Each example follows the standard character creation rules:

- **Starting XP:** 6 XP total (3 skills at rank 1 with 2 XP each, 4 skills at rank 0)
- **Starting Coins:** 350 coins for equipment (plus 10 unspendable coins)
- **Standard Gear:** Backpack, 2 pouches, traveler's clothes, hemp rope (1 load), camping kit (1 load), toolkit (1 load), rations d4 (1 load), torches d4 (1 load)
  - If an archetype lists a specific toolkit, it's the one from Standard Gear: it costs 0 extra coins and its load is already counted in the 5-load Standard Gear.

Each archetype includes recommended attributes, skill selections with talent choices, upbringing and background, equipment purchases within the 350 coin budget, and playstyle descriptions.

Feel free to customize these examples to match your vision or use them as-is for quick character creation.

## Customization Tips

**Adjusting Attributes**
While each example shows recommended attributes, you can swap the d8 and d4 to create different flavors:

- **Agile Fighter:** d8 AGI, d4 MND – Focus on light armor and quick weapons
- **Strong Archer:** d8 STR, d4 MND – Use heavy bows and thrown weapons

**Skill Variations**
The 3 rank 1 skills define your starting capabilities, but the 4 rank 0 skills show growth potential. Different rank 0 skills support varied secondary roles. Consider your party composition when selecting skills.

**Equipment Priorities**
With 350 coins, prioritize based on your role:

- **Frontline:** Invest in weapons and armor
- **Casters:** Get your catalyst (included in toolkit), save coins for consumables
- **Utility:** Balance between combat gear and tools

**Talent Flexibility**
Each rank 1 skill offers multiple talent options. Consider offensive talents for strikers, defensive talents for tanks, and utility talents for support roles.

Remember: These are starting points. Your character will grow and specialize as you gain XP and advance through the ranks!
