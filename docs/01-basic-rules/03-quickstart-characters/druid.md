- Bird — Fast flying scout with keen eyes and dive attack bursts.

**Playstyle & Advancement**

The Druid is perfect for players who want to blend with nature, shapeshift, and command elemental forces. Shape Changer provides incredible versatility, while Animal Companion gives you a loyal ally. Use nature magic to control the battlefield and support allies. Wilderness Expert makes wilderness travel easier for the whole party.

**Advancement:** Increase Mysticism to rank 2-3 for more powerful spells and Shape Changer options, raise Nature and Survival for wilderness mastery, add Lore for deeper nature knowledge, and consider more shapeshifting or elemental talents.
