**Combat Arts**

As a Fighting rank 1 character, you know **2 Combat Arts** for melee weapons. Recommended for a whip user (Brawl weapons):

- **Disarm** – Attempt to disarm immediately after this attack
- **Snare** – Grapple and restrain with your weapon on a hit

**Equipment**

- Whip (50 coins, 1 load)

**Animal Companion**

Use the companion base stat block with Tier equal to your Nature rank (see the Mounts & Companions rules). Then pick any one Animal trait to define your companion’s type.

Suggested traits:

- Dog — Loyal tracker with pack tactics and reliable grapples.
- Cat — Stealthy scout with pounce and knockdown.
- Boar — Durable frontline that can gore on a charge.

**Playstyle & Advancement**

The Tamer locks lanes and creates openings for their animal. Use Fast Stride to kite; Disarm to strip threats; Snare to pin priority targets so your companion can maul them. Pugilist improves your baseline brawl control with whips and grapples. Your companion is your second body—set up flanks and force bad choices.

**Advancement:** Raise Nature 2–3 to deepen companion options; Fighting 2–3 for more Combat Arts (Supreme Disarm, Flurry). Add Athletics or Survival for mobility and fieldcraft. Consider Field Medic from Nature for downtime care.
