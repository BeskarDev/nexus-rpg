**Playstyle & Advancement**

The Swashbuckler thrives on movement, misdirection, and momentum. Use Devious Tactics to set up openings, then strike with dual light blades; Dual Wielder removes the usual banes for two-weapon attacks. Swashbuckler shuts down enemy Quick Actions after you hit, letting you press the attack without fear of counters. Use Feint for reliable advantage and Disarm to punish weaponed foes. Coat blades with poison for nasty burst when needed.

**Advancement:** Raise Fighting to rank 2–3 for more Combat Arts (Supreme Feint, Quick Lunge, or Riposte). Boost Stealth for better scene control or pick Streetwise: Thug Tactics if you prefer gang-up brawling. Consider Defensive Dueling if you pivot to single-blade finesse. Add Fortitude for toughness and Influence for swagger-driven social play.
