# ⭐ Character Progression

![banner-img](/img/banner/character-progression-banner.png)

> "Each challenge we face carves new wisdom into our being. Through trial and sacrifice, the worthy rise from dust to stand among legends. This is the way of all who would walk the path of the gods."

## Experience Points (XP)

Experience Points represent the knowledge and skill your adventurer gains through overcoming challenges and exploring the world. You gain XP through participating in sessions, which you can then invest in your adventurer's skills during downtime periods.

### Earning XP

The base XP gain is **1 XP** per session (roughly 3-4 hours of real-world game time).

You can earn **2 XP** instead of 1 when you achieve significant milestones during a session:

- Defeating a powerful adversary
- Discovering valuable treasure
- Uncovering a well-protected secret
- Completing an important task for a patron or deity

> Example: During an expedition into the Howling Tombs, Arzhag the Warrior leads their companions in defeating a vengeful desert wraith guarding an ancient vault dedicated to Nakesh. The GM awards 2 XP instead of 1 for this significant achievement.

## Spending XP on Skills

During downtime periods, you can invest your earned XP into skills. The total amount of XP you can spend on any single skill depends on your Character Level (see below).

### Downtime Investment Rates

- **Active training** allows you to spend up to 4 XP per week
- **Other downtime activities** allow you to spend 2 XP per week on a selection of skills fitting for the chosen activity
- You can also learn entirely new skills, which start at 0 XP for a cost of coins and time

> Example: At Character Level 3, Sansar the Thief can spend up to 6 XP in any single skill. After returning to the city of Khatep-Run with 8 XP available, they spend a week actively training in the thieves' quarter and invest 4 XP into their Stealth skill, bringing it from 2 XP to 6 XP. This also allows them to pick any two new talents of rank 1 or 2 for the Stealth skill.

### Skill Ranks

As you invest XP in a skill, it increases in rank at specific thresholds:

| Skill Rank | Title | XP Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Apprentice | 0 |
| 1 | Novice | 2 |
| 2 | Adept | 6 |
| 3 | Expert | 12 |
| 4 | Master | 18 |
| 5 | Grandmaster | 24 |

> Example: Nagkhan the Sorcerer has 6 XP in their Arcana skill. This puts them at rank 2 (Adept). They'll need to invest 6 more XP to reach the next threshold of 12 XP for rank 3 (Expert).

## Character Level

Your Character Level advances automatically when your total spent XP reaches specific thresholds. This represents your adventurer's overall growth in capability and renown throughout the lands of Atakhet and beyond.

### Important Notes

- Only XP actually spent in skills counts toward level progression
- Each level grants specific passive bonuses to your adventurer's capabilities
- Higher levels allow you to invest more XP in individual skills

### Level Requirements and Level Up Rewards

| Level (Title) | Total XP | Max XP per Skill | Level Up Rewards |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** (Fresh) | 0 | 2 XP (Rank 1) | - |
| **2** (Novice) | 10 | 4 XP (Rank 1) | +2 HP, +1d on one Attribute (max. d8) |
| **3** (Proven) | 16 | 6 XP (Rank 2) | +2 HP, +1 Defense base value |
| **4** (Capable) | 24 | 10 XP (Rank 2) | +2 HP, +1d on one Attribute (max. d10) |
| **5** (Experienced) | 32 | 12 XP (Rank 3) | +2 HP, +1 Defense base value |
| **6** (Seasoned) | 42 | 16 XP (Rank 3) | +2 HP, +1d on one Attribute (max. d10) |
| **7** (Renowned) | 52 | 18 XP (Rank 4) | +2 HP, +1 Defense base value |
| **8** (Heroic) | 64 | 22 XP (Rank 4) | +2 HP, +1d on one Attribute (max. d12) |
| **9** (Epic) | 76 | 24 XP (Rank 5) | +2 HP, +1 Defense base value |
| **10** (Legendary) | 90 | 28 XP (Rank 5) | +2 HP, +1d on one Attribute (max. d12) |

> Example: Sephi the Seer has spent 18 XP across various skills including Mysticism, Insight, and Lore. This puts them at Character Level 3 (Proven), which means they can now invest up to 6 XP in any single skill. Since beginning their journey, they've gained +4 HP, increased their Spirit attribute from d6 to d8, and received +1 to all Defense values.

## Talent Points (TP)

Talent Points represent your adventurer's specialized abilities within each skill. These are the techniques, secrets, and methods that distinguish a simple practitioner from a true master.

### Earning and Spending TP

- You earn 1 TP for every 2 XP invested in a skill
- You can spend 1 TP to:
  - Learn a new talent for that skill at rank 1
  - Increase the rank of an existing talent (maximum rank equals your current rank in that skill)

> Example: Arzhag the Warrior has invested 6 XP in their Fighting skill (increasing the skill to rank 2), which gives them 3 TP to spend. After consulting with a battle-priest of Arasha, they use these points to learn "Disciplined Fighter" at rank 1, and "Axe Mastery" at rank 1 and 2, using all 3 TP.
