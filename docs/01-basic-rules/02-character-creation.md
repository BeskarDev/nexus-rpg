## Creation Steps

When creating a new adventurer, follow the steps below:

1. **Choose your Attributes**
    - You start with a d6 in all attributes. You can then choose to increase one attribute to d8, but you must also decrease one to d4 when doing so.
2. **Choose your Folk**
    - Also, choose a culture for your folk. You learn the language of your chosen culture, in addition to the common language of the region.
3. **Choose your Upbringing**
4. **Choose your Background**
5. **Determine your starting NPC Relationships**
    1. You start the game with three NPC relationships
    2. Randomly determine each NPCs role or simply choose from the list in the NPCs section
    3. Choose between your NPC relationships one to have an intimate (+2), one an indifferent (+0), and one a hostile (-2) disposition towards you
6. **Why did you become an adventurer?**
Pick one of the following keywords or choose your own (Write down your Motivation).
*Duty, Fame, Fortune, Freedom, Justice, Knowledge, Power, Redemption, Revenge, Survival*
7. **Choose your Skills**
    - Your upbringing and background give examples of fitting skills for your adventurer. Write down all suggested skills, or replace any number of them with other skills you see more fitting for your adventurer. At the end, you should have written down exactly seven distinct skills.
    - Choose three of these seven skills to start with 2 XP each. With this, these skills are improved to rank 1 and you can choose one rank 1 talent for each of them. Your other skills start at 0 XP and therefore rank 0. After your adventures, you can spend more XP on your learned skills and unlock talents for them with enough XP.
    - If you learned Archery or Fighting, you learn Combat Arts for weapons of the learned skill. See the Combat Arts section for more details.
    - If you learned Arcana or Mysticism, you learn spells for the learned skill. See the Magic section for more details.
    - If you learned Crafting, you learn one crafting profession. See the Crafting Professions section for more details.
8. **Choose your Equipment**
    - Starting Items:
        - A backpack (0 load (only first one, normally 1 load), 10 coins)
        - Two pouches (can hold up to 1 load, 0 load, 1 coin)
        - Travelerâ€˜s Clothes (0 load, 50 coins)
        - Hemp Rope (covers a medium distance, 1 load, 10 coins)
        - Camping kit (provides shelter for a nightâ€˜s rest for up to two people, 1 load, 50 coins)
        - One additional tool of your choice
        - Supplies:
            - rations (d6 Resource Die, 1 load, 10 coins per unit)
            - torches (d6 Resource Die, emit bright light in close range and dim light in short range when lit, 1 load, 10 coins per unit)
        - 10 coins (canâ€™t be spent during adventurer creation)
    - You also get 350 coins to spend on additional equipment and items.
        - Choosing a weapon that requires ammo gives you one unit of that weaponâ€™s ammo for free (e.g. arrows (d8) for a bow)
        - You keep coins you donâ€™t spend
9. **Start with 1 Resolve and fill out the remaining statistics on your adventurer sheet**
