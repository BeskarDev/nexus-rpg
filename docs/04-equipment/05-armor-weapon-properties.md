# #️⃣ Weapon & Armor Properties

 **Name** | **Description** 
---|---
 **agile** | You can roll attacks with Agility instead of Strength. When doing so, also use Agility as your base damage. 
 **ammo** | Needs ammunition to attack. 
 **AV +X** | Increases your Armor Value (AV) by X. 
 **bundle** | You carry multiple pieces of this weapon. They are treated as their own type of Supply and deplete with use, using the same rules as ammo. Note, that you can only carry d12 (5 units) of all your carried bundle weapons combined (see the Supply rules for more detail).<br />You can also use bundle weapon in melee, but suffer +1 bane on attacks due to their small reach. 
 **covering** | Can be placed down using an Action to act as stationary cover from a direction of your choice without you holding the item. You can use another Action to pick the item up again.  
 **crush** | Ignore 1/2 of the enemy’s AV. If you have another ability, that reduces the enemy’s Defense. Apply both reductions after each other. For example, if you ignore 1/2 AV twice, you ignore 3/4 AV in total. 
 **damaged** | You suffer +1 bane on attacks with a weapon or the AV bonus is halved for armor, helmets, or shields (min. 0). Another failed Durability check for this item destroys it, making it unusable until repaired. 
 **dodge X** | Increase your Dodge by X. 
 **double-sided** | This weapon can be used like dual-wielding two light weapons of the same type. 
 **entangle** | Before making an attack against a target the same size or smaller than you, you can choose to also grapple the target. When doing so, this attack also counts as a Grapple Action. On a hit, the target is grappled by your weapon. The grapple ends early when you make another attack with this weapon, unless it is a bundle weapon. 
 **fragile** | You must roll a Durability Check for this item after each use. This includes after each hit for a weapon or after each time you are hit by an attack for a shield, helmet, or armor.  
 **heavy (dX)** | For each Strength value below dX, suffer +1 bane on attacks for weapons or +1 bane on all Strength rolls for armor. 
 **light** | Can be dual-wielded. 
 **narrowed** | You suffer +1 bane on Perception rolls. 
 **noisy** | You suffer +1 bane on Stealth rolls. 
 **non-lethal** | Inflicts Fatigue instead of Wounds. 
 **parry X** | Increase your Parry by X. You can only benefit from one held item with this property at a time. 
 **pierce** | If your Attribute Die results in a 1 or a 2 on your attack rolls, you can re-roll the test. You must take the results of the new roll.  
 **range (X)** | You can attack with this ranged weapon at a maximum range of X. For each range category beyond medium, you suffer a cumulative +1 bane. 
 **reach** | You can attack enemies at close range. While any enemy is within melee range of you, you suffer +1 bane on the attack. 
 **reload** | Requires an Action to reload before you can attack again. 
 **rigid X** | Your Dodge is reduced by X. You suffer +X bane(s) on Athletics and Fortitude rolls based on movement and physical exertion, such as during travel, or for climbing, swimming, or sprinting. If you wear or wield multiple rigid items, you only suffer the highest value among them.  
 **slash** | Against enemies in light or no armor, double this weapon’s damage. 
 **switch** | Choose one of the properties listed for this weapon to gain for an attack. If you make multiple attacks during the same turn, switch between the listed properties for each individual attack. 
 **thrown (X)** | This weapon or it’s ammo can be thrown for ranged attacks at a range of up to X. For each range category beyond short, you suffer a cumulative +1 bane. You can roll thrown attacks with Strength instead of Agility (also for the base damage) and Fighting instead of Archery (choose any combination of either option). If the weapon is thrown, it is treated as a thrown ranged weapon even if it is normally a melee weapon. 
 **two-handed** | Requires both hands to attack. You can still choose to attack with only one hand, but suffer +2 banes on the attack roll. 
 **versatile (+X)** | This weapon can also be used with both hands. When doing so, it is treated as a two-handed weapon and deals +X weapon damage. Creatures smaller than medium size can only wield this weapon two-handed and don‘t add any bonus damage.
