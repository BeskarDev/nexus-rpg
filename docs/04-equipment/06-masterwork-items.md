# ⚒️ Masterwork Items

Masterwork items are crafted by only the finest craftsmen. Any masterwork version of an item is of Quality 3 unless the base version is already Quality 3 (such as crossbows), in which case the Quality is increased to 4.

A masterwork item costs 3 x base item cost + 200 coins (extra costs for special materials or enchantments are added afterward).

> For example, while a normal greatsword costs 200 coins, a masterwork “sharp greatsword” costs 800 coins ([3 x 200 base] + 200). It‘s Quality is also increased from 2 to 3 for being a masterwork item.
> 

| Base Cost | 50 coins | 100 coins | 150 coins | 200 coins | 500 coins | 1000 coins |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Masterwork Cost | 350 coins | 500 coins | 650 coins | 800 coins | 1,700 coins | 3,200 coins |

Any item made with enchantments or special materials that is of a higher Quality than the masterwork version of that item is automatically a masterwork item without increasing the Quality or cost further.

> For example, when crafting a longbow made from dragon bone, it is Quality 4 and costs 4,200 coins. It is also automatically a masterwork longbow and you can choose the „balanced“ or „recurve“ masterwork property for it without increasing the cost further.

When a craftsman creates a masterwork item, they can choose one of the following properties to enhance the basic item with.

## Melee Weapon Masterwork Properties

1. **Balanced.** If your Attribute Die results in a 1 or a 2 on your attack rolls, you can re-roll the test. You must take the results of the new roll. If this is a pierce weapon, you can also re-roll on a 3 for your Attribute Die.
2. **Elegant.** This weapon loses 1 load (min. 0,5) and gains the agile property.
3. **Massive.** This non-light weapon gains heavy (d8) or increases its heavy property by one step (max. d12) if it is already heavy. Increase its weapon damage and its load by 1 each.
4. **Sharp.** This non-crush weapon gains the slash property. If it already was a slash weapon, increase its weapon damage by 1 instead.

## Ranged Weapon Masterwork Properties

1. **Balanced.** If your Attribute Die results in a 1 or a 2 on your attack rolls, you can re-roll the test. You must take the results of the new roll. If this is a pierce weapon, you can also re-roll on a 3 for your Attribute Die.
2. **Recurve.** Increase the weapon damage of this bow by 1.
3. **Repeating.** This crossbow with reload can potentially fire multiple turns without taking an action to reload. After an attack with it, roll the Supply die for your ammo (this is not a Supply check). If you roll a 1 or 2, you have to take an Action to reload the crossbow. Otherwise, you can just attack it again the next time.
4. **Weighted.** Increase the weapon damage of this weapon when thrown by 1.

## Shield Masterwork Properties

1. **Light.** This shield loses 1 load (min. 0,5). Also, this shield’s heavy property is reduced by one step if it is heavy.
2. **Reinforced.** You gain +1 boon on rolls to prevent this shield from being disarmed.
3. **Spiked.** Increase the weapon damage of this shield by 1.
4. **Sturdy.** Using Combat Arts to bash or shove with this shield imposes +1 bane on the target’s roll against the effect.

## Spell Talisman Masterwork Properties

1. **Deflecting.** This Spell Focus gains +1 Parry as a property.
2. **Glowing.** This Spell Focus can emit light with short range. When using the focus for light you have to roll a Supply Check for light, instead roll a Durability Check for your Focus. If you fail, the item isn't damaged, but it can't emit light until the next day. 
3. **Stable.** If your Attribute Die results in a 1 or a 2 on your spell rolls, you can re-roll the test. You must take the results of the new roll.
4. **Volatile.** You can choose to gain +1 spell damage per SL on a spell, but also reduce your Attribute Dice by one step for the roll to cast the spell.
