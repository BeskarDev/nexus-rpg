# ⚒️ Masterwork Items

Normal items such as weapons represent the default of what would be available from an average craftsman, perhaps the level of quality you can expect from a large production for an army. Masterwork items on the other hand are singular pieces, often commissioned by great individuals to fit their specific needs and act as a symbol of wealth and power.

Masterwork items can only be crafted by the finest craftsmen and adventurers require a specific talent to be able to craft such items themselves. Any masterwork version of an item is of Quality 3 unless the base version is already Quality 3 (such as crossbows), in which case the Quality is increased to 4.

A masterwork item costs 3 x base item cost + 200 coins (extra costs for special materials or enchantments are added afterward).

> For example, while a normal greatsword with 4 weapon damage costs 200 coins, a masterwork greatsword with 5 weapon damage costs 800 coins ([3 x 200 base] + 200). It‘s Quality is also increased from 2 to 3 for being a masterwork item.
