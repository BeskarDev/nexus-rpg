# ⚒️ Masterwork & Exotic Weapons

## Masterwork Weapons

Normal weapons represent the default of what would be available from an average craftsman, perhaps the level of quality you can expect from a large production for an army. Masterwork weapons on the other hand are singular pieces, often commissioned by great individuals to fit their specific needs and act as a symbol of wealth and power.

Masterwork weapons can only be crafted by the finest craftsmen and adventurers require a specific talent to be able to craft such items themselves. Any masterwork version of a weapon is of Quality 3 unless the base version is already Quality 3 (such as crossbows), in which case the Quality is increased to 4.

A masterwork weapon costs 3 x base item cost + 200 coins (extra costs for special materials or enchantments are added afterward).

> For example, while a normal greatsword with 4 weapon damage costs 200 coins, a masterwork greatsword with 5 weapon damage costs 800 coins ([3 x 200 base] + 200). It‘s Quality is also increased from 2 to 3 for being a masterwork item.

| Base Cost | 50 coins | 100 coins | 150 coins | 200 coins | 500 coins | 1000 coins |

| Masterwork Cost | 350 coins | 500 coins | 650 coins | 800 coins | 1,700 coins | 3,200 coins |

Masterwork arcane conduits or mystic talismans increase your spell damage by +1/+2/+3 (enhancement bonus).

## Exotic Weapons

These weapons are special versions of normal weapons only found in specific areas, used by certain folks, or commissioned for non-traditional fighters. Exotic weapons are not inherently more powerful version of normal weapons, such as masterwork weapons. Instead, they offer additional properties to weapons which makes their usage more flexible.

> Any type of weapon can have an exotic counterpart, as long as it fulfills all requirements. Work with your GM to think of what makes an exotic weapon different for it to gain one of the following properties.
>

When crafting an exotic weapon, choose one of the following properties and increase the weapons cost by the amount specified.

**Balanced (+100 coins).** Reduce this heavy weapon‘s heavy Strength requirement by one step (min. d6).

**Elegant (+100 coins).** This non-heavy melee weapon gains the agile property.

**Massive (+100 coins).** This non-light melee weapon gains the heavy (d8) property.

**Repeating (+500 coins).** This crossbow with reload can potentially fire multiple turns without taking an action to reload. After an attack with it, roll the Supply die for your ammo (this is not a Supply check). If you roll a 1 or 2, you have to take an Action to reload the crossbow. Otherwise, you can attack with it again the next time without reloading.

**Spiked. (+100 coins).** Increase this shield‘s weapon damage by 1.

**Strapped (+50 coins).** Attempts to disarm this held weapon suffer +1 bane.
