# ⚒️ Masterwork Items

Masterwork items are crafted by only the finest craftsmen. Any masterwork version of a item is of one Quality higher than the basic version of it. A masterwork item costs 2 x base item cost + 200 coins (extra costs for special materials are added afterwards).

> For example, while a normal greatsword costs 200 coins, a masterwork “sharp greatsword” costs 600 coins ([2 x 200] + 200).

If the craftsman is also using special materials or enchantments on the item, which would increase the Quality of it beyond that of a masterwork version of the item, also making it a masterwork item doesn’t increase the Quality further. The extra cost is still added.

When a craftsman creates a masterwork item, they can choose one of the following properties to enhance the basic item with.

## Melee Weapon Masterwork Properties

1. **Balanced.** If your Attribute Die results in a 1 or a 2 on your attack rolls, you can re-roll the test. You must take the results of the new roll. If this is a pierce weapon, you can also re-roll on a 3 for your Attribute Die.
2. **Elegant.** This weapon loses 1 load (min. 0,5) and gains the agile property.
3. **Massive.** This non-light weapon gains heavy (d8) or increases its heavy property by one step (max. d12) if it is already heavy. It deals +1 weapon damage and increases it‘s load by 1.
4. **Sharp.** This non-crush weapon gains the slash property. If it already was a slash weapon, it deals +1 slash damage instead.

## Ranged Weapon Masterwork Properties

1. **Balanced.** If your Attribute Die results in a 1 or a 2 on your attack rolls, you can re-roll the test. You must take the results of the new roll. If this is a pierce weapon, you can also re-roll on a 3 for your Attribute Die.
2. **Recurve.** This bow deals +1 weapon damage.
3. **Repeating.** This crossbow with reload can potentially fire multiple turns without taking an action to reload. After an attack with it, roll the Supply die for your ammo (this is not a Supply check). If you roll a 1 or 2, you have to take an Action to reload the crossbow. Otherwise, you can just attack with it again the next time.
4. **Weighted.** This thrown weapon deals +1 weapon damage when thrown.

## Shield Masterwork Properties

1. **Light.** This shield loses 1 load (min. 0,5). Also this shield’s heavy property is reduced by one step if it is heavy.
2. **Reinforced.** You gain +1 boon on rolls to prevent this shield from being disarmed.
3. **Spiked.** This shield deals +1 weapon damage.
4. **Sturdy.** Using Combat Arts to bash or shove with this shield impose +1 bane on the target’s roll against the effect.

## Spell Focus Masterwork Properties

1. **Deflecting.** This Spell Focus gains +1 Parry as a property.
2. **Glowing.** This Spell Focus can emit light with short range. When using the focus for light and you have to roll a Supply Check for light, instead roll a Durability Check for your Focus. If you fail, the item isn't damaged, but it can't emit light until the next day. 
3. **Stable.** If your Attribute Die results in a 1 or a 2 on your spell rolls, you can re-roll the test. You must take the results of the new roll.
4. **Volatile.** You can choose to gain +1 spell damage on a spell, but also reduce your Attribute Dice by one step for the roll to cast the spell.
