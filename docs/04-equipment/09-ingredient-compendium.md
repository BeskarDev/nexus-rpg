## Ingredient Sources

### Harvesting from Creatures

Many ingredients come from defeated creatures. Use the **Harvesting Creature Parts** rules (see that section) to determine yields:

- **Tool harvest:** Venom glands, acid sacs, poison organs
- **Material harvest:** Scales, blood, bone, organs

The creature's Tier determines ingredient potency:

| Creature Tier | Max Ingredient Potency |
| --- | --- |
| 0-1 | Q1 |
| 2-3 | Q2 |
| 4-5 | Q3 |
| 6-7 | Q4 |
| 8-9 | Q5 |
| 10 | Q6+ |

### Gathering in the Wild

Use the **Gather Ingredients** downtime activity to collect natural ingredients:

- Location determines available types
- Season affects availability
- Success level determines quantity
- Some ingredients only appear in specific conditions

### Purchasing Ingredients

Availability varies by settlement:

| Settlement Rank | Max Ingredient Potency | Typical Markup |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (Hamlet) | Q1 | +10% |
| 2 (Village) | Q2 | +20% |
| 3 (Town) | Q3 | +30% |
| 4 (City) | Q4 | +50% |
| Special | Q5+ | +100% or more |

> **Note:** Higher potency ingredients (Q5+) are rarely sold openly. Characters must seek specialized alchemists, black markets, or quest for them directly.

## Ingredient Substitutions

Alchemists can sometimes substitute ingredients within the same category:

**Within Same Potency:**
- Any Essence can substitute for another Essence of same potency with +1 bane on crafting
- Catalysts can sometimes replace other Catalysts with GM approval
- Stabilizers and Binders are generally interchangeable

**Across Potency:**
- Higher potency ingredient can always substitute for lower (at alchemist's choice)
- Using lower potency ingredient limits final item Quality to that ingredient's maximum
- Cannot use Q3 ingredient to create Q5 item, even with all other Q5 ingredients

**Cross-Category Restrictions:**
- Cannot substitute Essence for Catalyst
- Cannot substitute poison-tagged ingredients for non-poison effects
- Reagents cannot replace core ingredients (Essence/Catalyst/Binder)

## Storage and Preservation

Raw ingredients degrade over time unless properly stored:

| Storage Method | Shelf Life | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **None (carried)** | 1 week | Free |
| **Basic (pouches)** | 1 month | 5 coins |
| **Preserved (sealed)** | 6 months | 20 coins |
| **Alchemical (stasis)** | 1 year | 50 coins |
| **Magical (indefinite)** | Permanent | 200 coins |

> **GM Option:** You can ignore ingredient degradation for simpler gameplay, assuming characters properly store their materials.

## Creating Custom Ingredients

GMs can create custom ingredients for their campaigns:

**Step 1:** Determine potency tier (Q1-Q7)

**Step 2:** Assign 1-3 tags based on source and intended use

**Step 3:** Set cost based on potency:
- Q1: 1-5 coins
- Q2: 5-25 coins
- Q3: 40-100 coins
- Q4: 200-400 coins
- Q5: 800-1,500 coins
- Q6+: 4,000+ coins

**Step 4:** Define source (creature, plant, mineral, magical)

**Step 5:** Add special properties if desired (seasonal, rare, regional)

**Example - Stormcrow Feather:**
- Potency: Q4
- Tags: Essence (weather), Catalyst (wind), Reagent (flight)
- Cost: 280 coins
- Source: Harvested from magical stormcrow (Q4 flying beast)
- Special: Only found during thunderstorms
