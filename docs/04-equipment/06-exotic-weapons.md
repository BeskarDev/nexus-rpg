## Exotic Weapons

These weapons are special versions of normal weapons only found in specific areas, used by certain folks, or commissioned for non-traditional fighters. Exotic weapons are not inherently more powerful version of normal weapons, such as masterwork weapons. Instead, they offer additional properties to weapons which makes their usage more flexible.

> Any type of weapon can have an exotic counterpart, as long as it fulfills all requirements. Work with your GM to think of what makes an exotic weapon different for it to gain one of the following properties.
>

When crafting an exotic weapon, choose one of the following properties and increase the weapons cost by the amount specified.

**Balanced (+100 coins).** Reduce this heavy weapon‘s heavy Strength requirement by one step (min. d6).

**Elegant (+100 coins).** This non-heavy melee weapon gains the agile property.

**Massive (+100 coins).** This non-light melee weapon gains the heavy (d8) property.

**Repeating (+500 coins).** This crossbow with reload can potentially fire multiple turns without taking an action to reload. After an attack with it, roll the Supply die for your ammo (this is not a Supply check). If you roll a 1 or 2, you have to take an Action to reload the crossbow. Otherwise, you can attack with it again the next time without reloading.

**Spiked. (+100 coins).** Increase this shield‘s weapon damage by 1.

**Strapped (+50 coins).** Attempts to disarm this held weapon suffer +1 bane.
