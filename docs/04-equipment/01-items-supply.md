## Tools

When you have a tool in your possession that would help you accomplish a roll you are about to attempt, gain +1 boon on the roll. This roll has to be possible without the tool, otherwise it just enables the roll but doesnâ€™t grant the boon. You can only benefit from one tool per roll.

## Supply

Supplies are consumable goods, that are not tracked as normal equipment. Instead, each type of supply has an associated Resource Die between d4 (1 unit) and d12 (5 units), where a d12 or 5 units are the most amount one person can physically take with them. At certain points during the game, you will have to roll your Resource Die. When you roll a 1 or 2, reduce your Resource Die by one step. Instead of reducing a d4 Resource Die, you consume all your remaining supply of that type.

Each Supplyâ€™s load always remains the same, regardless of itâ€˜s Resource Die size. For example, when you carry provisions in any amount, they always take up 1 load.

### Increasing and Decreasing Supply

When you gain supply, increase itâ€˜s Resource Die by one step for each unit. Buying supplies is done so unit by unit.

When you lose one unit of supply, reduce the supplyâ€˜s Resource Die.

### Types of Supply

Supply is grouped into different types that can be used for different purposes during adventures.

> Note, that the maximum amount of units you can carry are accumulated across one type of supply. So, if you are carrying 5 units of arrows, you canâ€˜t carry any more ammunition, even if they are other things like bolts. You can also mix multiple supplies of the same type, as long as you donâ€˜t exceed 5 units in total. This means, you could take up to d8 (3 units) arrows and d6 (2 units) bolts with you. In any case, all of your ammunition would collectively still only take up 1 load.
> 

**Ammo**

Roll once after a fight, in which you used ammo. You need different types of ammo for different types of ranged weapons.

**Provisions**

Roll once at the end of each day to receive the effects of a nightâ€˜s rest. A successful foraging or hunting roll might allow you to re-stock during travel.

**Light**

Roll once every hour or after each exploration turn, while exploring with the light source active.

**Materials**

Common, natural materials for repairing equipment, crafting simple items, building traps, treating wounds, or healing sicknesses. Can be re-stocked during travel by foraging.

**Bundles**

Bundles are a special type of supply. They are foremost weapons, but can be used like ammunition for attacking. They also include other items, such as alchemical substances. See the description for â€žbundleâ€œ under the Weapon and Armor Properties for more details.

## Repairing damaged items

While carrying a crafting kit, you can attempt to repair a damaged item during a night's rest. Roll Mind + Crafting against 6 + the itemâ€™s Quality as the difficulty and make a Supply check for materials. On a success, the item is no longer damaged. Destroyed items canâ€˜t be repaired this way and instead require a downtime activity.

## Encumbrance

Adventurers carry around a lot of equipment and loot. Encumbrance determines the amount of items they are able to carry with them on their person.

### Carrying Items

Normally any adventurer can only carry what they can hold in their hands, or wear on their body. To be able to carry more items than that, they need containers. Containers are worn items that can hold onto additional items. How many items any container can hold at maximum is determined by the items combined load (see below).

### Item Load

Carrying items accumulate load. Load is an abstracted measurement of weight and size. Once you carry too much load, you are either encumbered or even over-encumbered.

Generally, an item the size of a melon or up to 2 kilograms in weight is considered 1 load. Items the size of an orange or a few hundred grams in weight are 0.5 load. Smaller items are considered to have 0 load.

| Item, Object, or Animal | Load |
| --- | --- |
| dagger, linen bag | 0.5 |
| longsword, metal lantern, chicken | 1 |
| greatsword, domestic cat | 2 |
| wooden chest, small dog | 5 |
| metal chest, wild cat | 10 |
| wooden cart, big dog | 20 |
| wild boar, small crocodile | 50 |
| small bear, tiger, lion | 100 |
| horse | 200 |
| large crocodile | 500 |
| hippopotamus, rhinoceros | 1,000 |
| elephant | 2,000 |

### Becoming encumbered

An adventurerâ€™s maximum amount of load they can carry without being encumbered is equal to 2 x Strength. Once you carry 3 x Strength in load, you are over-encumbered and canâ€˜t carry any more load. How much you can carry is also affected by your method of storage. These values assume you carry a backpack and enough bags and pouches to store your items.

| Strength | Encumbrance Limit | Over-Encumbrance Limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| d4 | 8 load | 12 load |
| d6 | 12 load | 18 load |
| d8 | 16 load | 24 load |
| d10 | 20 load | 30 load |
| d12 | 24 load | 36 load |

Being encumbered or over-encumbered causes several effects.

**Encumbered.** You suffer +1 bane on Strength or Agility rolls for movement, such as climbing or swimming, and during travel.

**Over-Encumbered.** You canâ€˜t move. You canâ€˜t use any Actions or do any rolls for physical activity.
