# Magic Item Effects

## Magic Item Effects

### Magic Weapons and Spell Catalysts

Magic weapons and spell catalysts increase their weapon or spell damage by +1 for each step above their original Quality respectively and increases their innate Durability. The following table describes the exact bonuses magic weapons and spell catalysts gain. Quality 3 is a special case, where the items count as non-magical masterworks but follow the same principle.

| Quality | Weapon/Spell Damage | Durability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3* | +1/+0* | - |
| 4 | +1 | +1d |
| 5 | +2 | +1d |
| 6 | +3 | +2d |
| 7 | +4 | +2d |
| 8 | +5 | +3d |

> Weapons which are already Quality 3 in their mundane form can also be made as masterwork versions for the extra cost but only to gain access to a masterwork property. Such weapons **don’t** get an increase to their weapon damage as their base form is already of the same Quality.
>

### Magic Armor, Shields, and Helmets

Masterwork armor, shields, and helmets increase their defensive capabilities with increased Quality. These higher Quality pieces are only available at minimum Quality 4 in contrast to weapons.

> Shields are treated as both weapons and armor for the benefits of masterwork items. This means that a Quality 4 light shield will both increase it’s weapon damage from 2 to 3 and it’s AV bonus from 1 to 2. Bucklers also gain the magic item AV bonus, although they don’t grant one in their mundane form.

| Quality | AV Bonus | Durability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | +1 | +1d |
| 5 | +2 | +1d |
| 6 | +3 | +2d |
| 7 | +4 | +2d |
| 8 | +5 | +3d |

### Magic Ammo

Ranged attacks with magic ammo deal extra damage on a hit. This bonus does not count towards weapon damage but gives a flat damage bonus depending on it's Quality. Magic ammo names include the bonus suffix (e.g., "Arrows +2" for Q4).

Magic ammo comes as units of supply, the same way mundane ammo does. The exception are enchanted pieces of ammo, which are further described below.

| Quality | Damage Bonus |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | +1 |
| 4 | +2 |
| 5 | +3 |
| 6 | +4 |
| 7 | +5 |
| 8 | +6 |

#### Enchanted Ammo

In contrast to weapons and armor, magic ammo normally doesn‘t have an enchantment. You can still buy or craft enchanted pieces of ammo, but they come in individual pieces per use. So one item slot for enchanted ammo with up to three uses represents up to three physical pieces of that ammo. Usually, once such a piece of ammo has successfully hit it‘s target or otherwise activated it‘s enchantment, it is destroyed and you have to spend 1 use for it.

> One item slot with up to three pieces of enchanted ammo costs the same amount of coins as one normal stack of magic ammo of the same Quality. So for example, 3 pieces of Q4 exploding arrows +1 cost 315 coins (15 + 150 + 150). In the same way, one stack of normal Q4 magic arrows costs 165 coins but comes with three full uses as supply instead.
>
> Enchanted ammo still gains the same damage bonus for it‘s Quality as regular magic ammo.

### Spell Scrolls

Spell scrolls contain sacred words or ancient arcane symbols written with magical ink. These magical inscriptions contain single uses of specific spells, which any intelligent creature can read aloud to invoke the spell's effect, after which the scroll turns to dust.

**Casting for Spellcasters:** Reciting the inscription always requires an Action. If you have learned Arcana or Mysticism for arcane or mystic spell scrolls respectively, you can cast the spell normally without paying its Focus cost (you can't use any Metamagic Arts with it).

**Casting for Non-Spellcasters:** If you haven't learned the appropriate magical skill, the scroll itself empowers you with the knowledge to cast it. Use the attribute dice and skill bonus provided by the scroll's Quality tier when making any tests required to cast the spell.

**Crafting Spell Scrolls:** When creating a spell scroll yourself, you must have learned the talent "Spell Scribe", be able to cast the chosen spell, and pay half the scroll's cost during the given amount of downtime. Spell scrolls have 0 load.

| Quality | Spell Rank | Attribute Die | Skill Bonus | Cost | Crafting Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 (Faint) | 0 | d6 | +1 | 50 coins | 1 hour |
| 4 (Lesser) | 1 | d8 | +1 | 150 coins | 1 day |
| 5 (Potent) | 2 | d10 | +2 | 500 coins | 1 week |
| 6 (Greater) | 3 | d10 | +3 | 1,500 coins | 2 weeks |
| 7 (Superior) | 4 | d12 | +4 | 5,000 coins | 4 weeks |
| 8 (Supreme) | 5 | d12 | +5 | 15,000 coins | 8 weeks |

**Random Scrolls**: Roll to determine scroll type and spell discipline/tradition:

| d6 | Scroll Type | | d6 | Arcane Spell Discipline | | d8 | Mystic Spell Tradition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-3 | arcane spell | | 1 | Evocation | | 1 | Light |
| 4-6 | mystic spell | | 2 | Illusion | | 2 | Twilight |
|  |  | | 3 | Conjuration | | 3 | Life |
|  |  | | 4 | Telepathy | | 4 | Death |
|  |  | | 5 | Telekinetics | | 5 | Nature |
|  |  | | 6 | Necromancy | | 6 | Tempest |
|  |  |  |  | | | 7 | Peace |
|  |  |  |  | | | 8 | War |
