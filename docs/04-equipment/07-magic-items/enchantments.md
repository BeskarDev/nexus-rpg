# Enchantments

## Enchantments

Enchantments are optional magical properties for items of Q4+. Each enchantment adds its full cost to the item (see Enchantment Cost table).

### Enchanting items

Any non-enchanted item of Quality 3 or higher can be enchanted. Magic items can only hold one enchantment, unless they are exceptionally powerful items found during adventures. Crafting an enchantment requires:

- an enchanter capable of creating magical items,
- the appropriate ritual during downtime, and
- magical ingredients worth at least half the enchantment's cost.

Removing an enchantment is difficult and often destroys the item.

> **Stacking**
>
> If multiple equipped items provide the same enchantment effect, only the highest effect applies. This covers passive and stat effects; active abilities that require an Action or Quick Action are not blocked by this rule. Example: boots of reflexes +1 and cloak of reflexes +2 both grant Dodge — only the +2 applies.

> **Prefix vs. Suffix**
>
> Enchantment effects come in two forms, as a prefix or a suffix to the base items name.
>
> - Prefix enchantments grant active or triggered abilities (common on weapons, catalysts, armor, and shields).
> - Suffix enchantments grant passive bonuses (wearables always use suffixes). Enchanted ammo uses prefix enchantments. If a suffix is needed for a non-wearable item, roll on the wearable table.
> 
> If a randomly rolled enchantment is not compatible with an item, re-roll.

> **Scaling by Quality**
>
> Each enchantment lists the Qualities where it appears; numeric variables scale with Quality. For example, "of Protection" at Q4 = +1 AV, Q5 = +2 AV, Q6 = +3 AV. Note that some enchantments are not available for all tiers of Quality.

### Ammo Enchantments

| d6 | Prefix |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **burning (Q4/Q5/Q6).** This projectile ignites itself when fired. On a hit, inflict burning (4/6/8) to the target. |
| 2 | **draining (Q5).** On a hit, the target is briefly stunned. You can only use this effect once per scene against any individual target. |
| 3 | **ensnaring (Q4/Q5/Q6).** On hit, magical vines erupt from the projectile to entangle the target. A large or smaller target is grappled by the vines. The target’s rolls to escape the grapple are made vs. medium/hard/very hard Difficulty (8/10/12). |
| 4 | **shattering (Q4/Q5/Q6).** On a hit, the projectile explodes into a loud bang, dealing 4/6/8 blast damage (ignoring AV) to the target and each other creature within melee range of them. On a strong or critical hit, the target is also knocked prone. |
| 5 | **seeking (Q4/Q6).** This shot curves unnaturally toward its mark. Ignore any penalties from range or cover and gain +1 boon on this attack. At Q6, you can also target creatures behind full cover, as long as there is a possible flight path for the projectile and you are aware of their location. |
| 6 | **wounding (Q4/Q5/Q6).** On a hit, inflict bleeding (4/6/8) on the target. You can only use this effect once per scene against any individual target. |

### Weapon Enchantments

| d12 | Prefix |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **bloody (Q4/Q5/Q6).** On a strong or critical hit with this weapon, inflict bleeding (2/4/6) on the target. If your hit would inflict bleeding already, increase the amount by +2/+4/+6 instead. |
| 2 | **booming (Q4/Q5/Q6).** On a hit with this weapon, you can choose to deal blast damage instead. On a strong or critical hit, the target is also pushed a close/short/medium distance.<br/>You can use this ability once/twice/thrice per day. |
| 3 | **defiled (Q4/Q5/Q6).** This weapon is tainted with dark energy, causing nearby plants to slowly wither and exuding a faint aura of malevolence. You can use your Quick Action on your turn to amplify this corruption for a short duration.<br/>While amplified, the weapon turns bright light to dim light in close range and deals 2/4/6 necrotic damage (ignoring AV) on a hit. |
| 4 | **flaming (Q4/Q5/Q6).** While holding this weapon, you can use your Quick Action on your turn to ignite it with flames for a short duration.<br/>While ignited, the weapon emits bright light in melee range, dim light in close range, and deals 2/4/6 fire damage (ignoring AV) on a hit. |
| 5 | **infused (Q4/Q5/Q6).** While holding this weapon, you can use your Quick Action on your turn to regain 4/6/8 Focus. You can use this ability once per day. |
| 6 | **morphing (Q4).** Choose any second type of weapon. When applying this enchantment during crafting, you must use and destroy that weapon (at least masterwork quality) as part of the enchanting process.<br/>This weapon combines both weapon forms into one, stretching or contracting it's parts upon activation to assume a different shape. If you speak the command word as a Quick Action, the weapon transforms from one of it's forms into the other one. The weapon retains all mundane and magical properties of the original weapons when their respective shape is used.<br/>**Cost:** Add both base item costs and material extra costs together, but pay the enchantment cost only once. Example: Q4 bronze shortsword/longbow = 50 + 0 + 100 + 0 + 1,000 = 1,150 coins. |
| 7 | **poisoner's (Q4/Q6).** When applying any type of poison to this weapon, add +2/+4 to any poison damage it deals (for weapon poisons) or increase the difficulty to end the poisons effect by one/two step(s) (for paralyzing poisons). |
| 8 | **returning (Q4).** After using a short break to attune yourself to it, the weapon becomes magically linked to your person. It gains the thrown (short/medium) property. While the weapon is in long range of you and you can see it, you can use a Quick Action to command it to return to you. If the weapon's path is unobstructed, it quickly flies back into your hand (you must have a free hand to do this). |
| 9 | **sacred (Q4/Q5/Q6).** This weapon is blessed with divine power, emanating a gentle warmth and providing comfort to the faithful. You can use your Quick Action on your turn to channel greater divine energy through it for a short duration.<br/>While channeling, the weapon radiates bright light in melee range, dim light in close range, and deals 2/4/6 radiant damage (ignoring AV) on a hit. |
| 10 | **sentinel (Q4/Q5).** During this weapon's creation, choose one type or subtype of creature (Humanoid, Beast, Monstrosity, Spirit, Automaton, Undead, Aberration, or any specific subtype such as Giant, Goblinoid, Celestial, etc.).

## Appendix

### Special Material Trade Values

Special materials are valuable trade goods that can be bought, sold, or harvested from creatures. Their value is based on quality tier, with prices listed per load.

#### Cost per Load

| Quality | Cost per Load |
| --- | --- |
| **Q3** | 450 coins |
| **Q4** | 1,500 coins |
| **Q5** | 4,500 coins |
| **Q6** | 15,000 coins |
| **Q7** | 45,000 coins |
| **Q8** | 150,000 coins |

#### Material Required by Item Type

Different item types require different amounts of material to craft:

- **One-handed weapons/spell catalysts**: 1 load
- **Two-handed/heavy weapons**: 2 loads
- **Light armor/shields/helmets**: 2 loads
- **Heavy armor**: 4 loads
- **Wearables**: 0.5 loads
- **Ammo/consumables**: 0.25 loads

**Total material cost** = Cost per load × loads required

> Example: Q6 dragon scales cost 15,000 coins per load. Heavy armor requires 4 loads, so crafting Q6 dragon scale heavy armor requires 60,000 coins worth of materials (4 × 15,000). A one-handed weapon needs only 1 load = 15,000 coins of material.

**Harvesting:** Use the creature harvesting rules to determine what materials can be obtained from defeated monsters. The quality tier of harvested materials typically matches the creature's challenge level.

### Enchantment Components by Effect Type

Enchantments require magical components worth at least half the enchantment cost. These ingredients provide thematic flavor and can be harvested from creatures or found in magical locations.
