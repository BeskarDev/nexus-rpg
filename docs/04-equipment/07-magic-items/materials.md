# Special Materials

## Materials

All items are crafted from materials that determine their construction, durability, and appearance.

### Material Categories

**Primitive Materials (Q1).** Primitive materials are cheap, makeshift alternatives. Items made from Q1 materials are functional but fragile and more likely to break. They exist to represent low-tech or improvised equipment and are typically limited to low-cost items.

**Mundane Materials (Q2).** Q2 is the default material tier for mundane items. These are the everyday, well-made materials (bronze, leather, hardwood) used across settlements.

**Magical Materials (Q3+).** Required for all magic items. These are mundane materials magically infused during forging, or natural materials from spiritually-charged locations (ancient groves, meteor impacts, mana-rich veins). They provide the foundation for magic items but grant no further mechanical properties on their own.

**Special Materials (Optional).** Specific named materials like Mithril, Adamantite, or Dragon Scales. These provide unique mechanical benefits beyond standard quality bonuses.

> **Example Comparison**
>
> - **Q5 bronze longsword**: Masterfully crafted bronze. Gains +2 damage and +1d durability. No extra cost.
> - **Q5 magic longsword +2**: Requires magical materials. Costs 50 (base) + 3,000 (magic item base cost) = 3,050 coins.
> - **Q5 adamantite longsword +2**: Uses special material. Costs 50 (base) + 3,000 (magic base) + 1,500 (special material) = 4,550 coins.

### Materials - Primitive (Q1)

Crude makeshift items for tribes without better materials.

| d8 | Material | Properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Bone** | *Sourced from beasts or humanoids. Lightweight but brittle; breaks under strong impacts.*<br/><br/>The item gains the fragile property. |
| 2 | **Copper** | *Soft reddish metal. Easy to shape, but poor durability for weapons or armor.*<br/><br/>The item gains the fragile property. |
| 3 | **Fresh Wood** | *Cut from living trees without drying or treatment. Warps easily and lacks strength.*<br/><br/>The item gains the fragile property. |
| 4 | **Stone** | *Rough, heavy, and crude. Can be shaped into tools or weapons, but prone to chipping.*<br/><br/>The item gains the fragile property. |
| 5 | **Flint** | *Sharp when fractured. Good for cutting edges but extremely brittle.*<br/><br/>The item gains the fragile property. |
| 6 | **Bark** | *Flexible but weak. Used for basic armor or bindings, mostly ceremonial or temporary.*<br/><br/>The item gains the fragile property. |
| 7 | **Reed** | *Hollow and very light. Used for simple shafts or padding, but offers no real durability.*<br/><br/>The item gains the fragile property. |
| 8 | **Shell** | *Hard outer layer from aquatic creatures. Smooth and rigid, but fragile under pressure.*<br/><br/>The item gains the fragile property. |

### Materials - Mundane (Q2-Q8)

Standard materials available at all quality tiers.

| 2 | **Bronze** | *Standard metal for tools and weapons. Balanced in strength, weight, and workability.* **No mechanical effect.** |
| 3 | **Hardwood** | *Dense, seasoned wood. Durable and shock-absorbent; used for bows, clubs, and shields.* **No mechanical effect.** |
| 4 | **Leather** | *Treated animal skin. Flexible, provides basic protection; common for light armor.* **No mechanical effect.** |
| 5 | **Horn** | *Solid, curved keratin. Used for weapon hilts, tips, and decorative armor parts.* **No mechanical effect.** |
| 6 | **Hide** | *Thick, untreated skin. Tougher than leather, but less flexible.* **No mechanical effect.** |
| 7 | **Antler** | *Hard and naturally curved. Effective for piercing weapons or rugged tools.* **No mechanical effect.** |
| 8 | **Obsidian** | *Volcanic mineral which can be crafted into very sharp razor blades, though extremely brittle and easily breaking.*<br/><br/>The item gains the fragile property. Weapon/Ammo: +1 weapon damage (enhancement bonus). |
