# Cost Tables

## Cost Tables

### Base Item Cost

Select any type of valid item (ammo / consumable, weapon, armor, or spell catalyst) as the base item and use their mundane cost.

For wearable items, use the applicable base cost for by equipment slot from this table:

| Equipment Slot | Min. Base Cost |
| --- | --- |
| **Head** (helmet, headband, mask) | 50 coins |
| **Neck** (amulet, brooch, scarf) | 50 coins |
| **Back** (cape, cloak, mantle) | 100 coins |
| **Body** (robe, tunic) | 100 coins |
| **Hands** (bracers, bracelets, gloves) | 50 coins |
| **Rings** | 50 coins |
| **Waist** (belt, sash, girdle) | 50 coins |
| **Feet** (boots, sandals, shoes) | 100 coins |

> Example: Q4 amulet of protection = 50 + 1,000 = 1,050 coins (wearables skip magic item base cost)

### Magic Item Base Cost

Base cost for crafting magic items by quality tier. All magic items are Quality 3 or higher and require exotic or magical materials. **Wearable items skip this cost** as they only gain value from their enchantments.

| Quality | Ammo / Consumables | One-handed Weapon / Spell Catalyst | Two-handed or Heavy Weapon | Light Armor / Shield / Helmet | Heavy Armor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **3** (Masterwork) | +50 coins | +300 coins | +500 coins | +500 coins | +1,000 coins |
| **4** (Lesser Magic) | +150 coins | +1,000 coins | +1,500 coins | +1,500 coins | +3,000 coins |
| **5** (Potent Magic) | +500 coins | +3,000 coins | +5,000 coins | +5,000 coins | +10,000 coins |
| **6** (Greater Magic) | +1,500 coins | +10,000 coins | +15,000 coins | +15,000 coins | +30,000 coins |
| **7** (Superior Magic) | +5,000 coins | +30,000 coins | +50,000 coins | +50,000 coins | +100,000 coins |
| **8** (Supreme Magic) | +15,000 coins | +100,000 coins | +150,000 coins | +150,000 coins | +300,000 coins |

### Special Material Extra Cost

Optional upgrade to use a specific named magical material (Chitin, Mithril, Dragon Scales, etc.) for unique properties. Wearables can use special materials even though they skip the magic item base cost. To see what these special materials cost themselves, reference the table down in the appendix.

| Quality | Ammo / Consumables | One-handed Weapon / Spell Catalyst | Two-handed or Heavy Weapon | Light Armor / Shield / Helmet | Heavy Armor | Wearable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **3** (Masterwork) | +25 coins | +150 coins | +250 coins | +250 coins | +500 coins | +150 coins |
| **4** (Lesser Magic) | +75 coins | +500 coins | +750 coins | +750 coins | +1,500 coins | +500 coins |
| **5** (Potent Magic) | +250 coins | +1,500 coins | +2,500 coins | +2,500 coins | +5,000 coins | +1,500 coins |
| **6** (Greater Magic) | +750 coins | +5,000 coins | +7,500 coins | +7,500 coins | +15,000 coins | +5,000 coins |
| **7** (Superior Magic) | +2,500 coins | +15,000 coins | +25,000 coins | +25,000 coins | +50,000 coins | +15,000 coins |
| **8** (Supreme Magic) | +7,500 coins | +50,000 coins | +75,000 coins | +75,000 coins | +150,000 coins | +50,000 coins |

### Enchantment Cost

Optional enchantments for a magic item which provide powerful effects or passive enhancements. Each magic item can only hold up to one enchantment. Wearable enchantments cost the same as one-handed weapons since wearables don't have inherent magical benefits.

| Quality | Ammo / Consumables | One-handed Weapon / Spell Catalyst | Two-handed or Heavy Weapon | Light Armor / Shield / Helmet | Heavy Armor | Wearable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **3** (Masterwork) | +50 coins | +300 coins | +500 coins | +500 coins | +1,000 coins | +300 coins |
| **4** (Lesser Magic) | +150 coins | +1,000 coins | +1,500 coins | +1,500 coins | +3,000 coins | +1,000 coins |

| **8** (Supreme Magic) | +15,000 coins | +100,000 coins | +150,000 coins | +150,000 coins | +300,000 coins | +75,000 coins |
