# 💎 Magic Items

![banner-img](/img/banner/weapon-armor-materials-banner.png)

Magic items are higher Quality versions of normal equipment that enhance your character's combat prowess, spellcasting power, and survivability. From flaming swords that ignite with fire to armor that deflects spells, from boots that enhance reflexes to amulets that store magical energy—magic items are key to facing deadlier foes and surviving legendary adventures.

## Acquiring Magic Items

Adventurers typically acquire magic items by **finding them in treasure hoards** (ancient tombs, dragon lairs, ruins), **looting defeated enemies**, or **receiving them as quest rewards**. In large cities, you may **purchase** magic items from specialty merchants or auction houses, though availability depends on the settlement's size and importance. Alternatively, you can **commission** an enchanter or runesmith to craft custom items, or **create them yourself** with the appropriate Crafting talents and magical skills (Arcana or Mysticism).

> **Materials matter.** Magic items require special materials (mithril, dragon scales, adamantite) and magical ingredients (creature parts, rare herbs, elemental essences). These can be harvested from defeated monsters, discovered in magical locations, or purchased from specialized traders. The right materials enable specific enchantments—a phoenix feather might grant fire resistance, while a monster's heart could power a life-draining weapon.


## How to Build a Magic Item

<MagicItemBuilderWrapper />

**Formula: Total Cost = Base Item + Magic Item Base Cost + Special Material (optional) + Enchantment (optional)**

> Note: Wearable items skip the Magic Item Base Cost—they only gain value from enchantments.

1. **Choose Base Item**: Select the item type (weapon, armor, wearable, etc.)
2. **Choose Quality Tier** (Q3-Q8): Select the magic item's quality tier and add the corresponding magic item base cost
   - Magic items start at Quality 3 (Masterwork) and require magical materials
   - Wearables skip this cost as they provide no inherent magical benefits
3. **Special Material** (Optional): Upgrade to a specific named material (Chitin, Mithril, Dragon Scales, etc.) for unique properties
4. **Add Enchantment** (Optional): Add magical abilities (see enchantment table)

**Examples:**

- Q4 magic longsword +1 = 50 + 1,000 = 1,050 coins
- Q5 mithril breastplate +2 = 750 + 10,000 + 5,000 = 15,750 coins
- Q6 flaming adamantite longsword +3 = 100 + 10,000 + 5,000 + 10,000 = 25,100 coins
- Q4 amulet of protection = 50 + 1,000 = 1,050 coins (wearables skip magic item base cost)
