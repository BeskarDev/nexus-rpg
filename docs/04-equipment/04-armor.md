# 🛡️ Armor

![banner-img](/img/banner/armor-banner.png)

Armor grants it's wearer protection in exchange for decreased mobility.

## Stacking AV Bonuses

By equipping many different types of protective items, as well as other abilities and effects, you gain a cumulative amount of AV from all those sources.

However, you can only ever gain AV from one piece of armor, one shield, and one helmet at the same time. Different pieces of equipment and abilities specify if their AV bonus counts for one of those slots.

> For any effect that says: “you gain +2 AV (armor bonus)”, that bonus doesn’t stack if you already wear armor that grants AV.
> 

If you would gain AV from multiple sources, but they both count as your armor/shield/helmet bonus, you only gain one of those bonuses (your choice).
