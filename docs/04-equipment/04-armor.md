# üõ°Ô∏è Armor

Armor grants it‚Äòs wearer protection in exchange for decreased mobility.

## Gaining AV from multiple sources

By equipping many different types of protective items, as well as other abilities and effects, you gain a cumulative amount of AV from all those sources.

You can only ever gain AV from one armor, one shield, and one helmet at a time, in addition to other effects which don‚Äòt specify one of those three sources of AV. Other abilities might also grant AV in place for armor, a shield, or a helmet. For example, when an ability mentions ‚Äûgain +X AV as armor‚Äú you can only add that AV bonus in place of other armor you would wear.
