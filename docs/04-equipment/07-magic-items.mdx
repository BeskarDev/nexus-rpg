# 💎 Magic Items

![banner-img](/img/banner/weapon-armor-materials-banner.png)

Magic items are higher Quality versions of normal equipment that enhance your character's combat prowess, spellcasting power, and survivability. From flaming swords that ignite with fire to armor that deflects spells, from boots that enhance reflexes to amulets that store magical energy—magic items are key to facing deadlier foes and surviving legendary adventures.

## Acquiring Magic Items

Adventurers typically acquire magic items by **finding them in treasure hoards** (ancient tombs, dragon lairs, ruins), **looting defeated enemies**, or **receiving them as quest rewards**. In large cities, you may **purchase** magic items from specialty merchants or auction houses, though availability depends on the settlement's size and importance. Alternatively, you can **commission** an enchanter or runesmith to craft custom items, or **create them yourself** with the appropriate Crafting talents and magical skills (Arcana or Mysticism).

> **Materials matter.** Magic items require special materials (mithril, dragon scales, adamantite) and magical ingredients (creature parts, rare herbs, elemental essences). These can be harvested from defeated monsters, discovered in magical locations, or purchased from specialized traders. The right materials enable specific enchantments—a phoenix feather might grant fire resistance, while a monster's heart could power a life-draining weapon.

## How to Build a Magic Item

<MagicItemBuilderWrapper />

**Formula: Total Cost = Base Item + Magic Item Base Cost + Special Material (optional) + Enchantment (optional)**

> Note: Wearable items skip the Magic Item Base Cost—they only gain value from enchantments.

1. **Choose Base Item**: Select the item type (weapon, armor, wearable, etc.)
2. **Choose Quality Tier** (Q3-Q8): Select the magic item's quality tier and add the corresponding magic item base cost
   - Magic items start at Quality 3 (Masterwork) and require magical materials
   - Wearables skip this cost as they provide no inherent magical benefits
3. **Special Material** (Optional): Upgrade to a specific named material (Chitin, Mithril, Dragon Scales, etc.) for unique properties
4. **Add Enchantment** (Optional): Add magical abilities (see enchantment table)

**Examples:**

- Q4 magic longsword +1 = 50 + 1,000 = 1,050 coins
- Q5 mithril breastplate +2 = 750 + 10,000 + 5,000 = 15,750 coins
- Q6 flaming adamantite longsword +3 = 100 + 10,000 + 5,000 + 10,000 = 25,100 coins
- Q4 amulet of protection = 50 + 1,000 = 1,050 coins (wearables skip magic item base cost)

## Cost Tables

### Base Item Cost

Select any type of valid item (ammo / consumable, weapon, armor, or spell catalyst) as the base item and use their mundane cost.

For wearable items, use the applicable base cost for by equipment slot from this table:

| Equipment Slot | Min. Base Cost |
| --- | --- |
| **Head** (helmet, headband, mask) | 50 coins |
| **Neck** (amulet, brooch, scarf) | 50 coins |
| **Back** (cape, cloak, mantle) | 100 coins |
| **Body** (robe, tunic) | 100 coins |
| **Hands** (bracers, bracelets, gloves) | 50 coins |
| **Rings** | 50 coins |
| **Waist** (belt, sash, girdle) | 50 coins |
| **Feet** (boots, sandals, shoes) | 100 coins |

> Example: Q4 amulet of protection = 50 + 1,000 = 1,050 coins (wearables skip magic item base cost)

### Magic Item Base Cost

Base cost for crafting magic items by quality tier. All magic items are Quality 3 or higher and require exotic or magical materials. **Wearable items skip this cost** as they only gain value from their enchantments.

| Quality | Ammo / Consumables | One-handed Weapon / Spell Catalyst | Two-handed or Heavy Weapon | Light Armor / Shield / Helmet | Heavy Armor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **3** (Masterwork) | +50 coins | +300 coins | +500 coins | +500 coins | +1,000 coins |
| **4** (Lesser Magic) | +150 coins | +1,000 coins | +1,500 coins | +1,500 coins | +3,000 coins |
| **5** (Potent Magic) | +500 coins | +3,000 coins | +5,000 coins | +5,000 coins | +10,000 coins |
| **6** (Greater Magic) | +1,500 coins | +10,000 coins | +15,000 coins | +15,000 coins | +30,000 coins |
| **7** (Superior Magic) | +5,000 coins | +30,000 coins | +50,000 coins | +50,000 coins | +100,000 coins |
| **8** (Supreme Magic) | +15,000 coins | +100,000 coins | +150,000 coins | +150,000 coins | +300,000 coins |

### Special Material Extra Cost

Optional upgrade to use a specific named magical material (Chitin, Mithril, Dragon Scales, etc.) for unique properties. Wearables can use special materials even though they skip the magic item base cost. To see what these special materials cost themselves, reference the table down in the appendix.

| Quality | Ammo / Consumables | One-handed Weapon / Spell Catalyst | Two-handed or Heavy Weapon | Light Armor / Shield / Helmet | Heavy Armor | Wearable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **3** (Masterwork) | +25 coins | +150 coins | +250 coins | +250 coins | +500 coins | +150 coins |
| **4** (Lesser Magic) | +75 coins | +500 coins | +750 coins | +750 coins | +1,500 coins | +500 coins |
| **5** (Potent Magic) | +250 coins | +1,500 coins | +2,500 coins | +2,500 coins | +5,000 coins | +1,500 coins |
| **6** (Greater Magic) | +750 coins | +5,000 coins | +7,500 coins | +7,500 coins | +15,000 coins | +5,000 coins |
| **7** (Superior Magic) | +2,500 coins | +15,000 coins | +25,000 coins | +25,000 coins | +50,000 coins | +15,000 coins |
| **8** (Supreme Magic) | +7,500 coins | +50,000 coins | +75,000 coins | +75,000 coins | +150,000 coins | +50,000 coins |

### Enchantment Cost

Optional enchantments for a magic item which provide powerful effects or passive enhancements. Each magic item can only hold up to one enchantment. Wearable enchantments cost the same as one-handed weapons since wearables don't have inherent magical benefits.

| Quality | Ammo / Consumables | One-handed Weapon / Spell Catalyst | Two-handed or Heavy Weapon | Light Armor / Shield / Helmet | Heavy Armor | Wearable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **3** (Masterwork) | +50 coins | +300 coins | +500 coins | +500 coins | +1,000 coins | +300 coins |
| **4** (Lesser Magic) | +150 coins | +1,000 coins | +1,500 coins | +1,500 coins | +3,000 coins | +1,000 coins |
| **5** (Potent Magic) | +500 coins | +3,000 coins | +5,000 coins | +5,000 coins | +10,000 coins | +3,000 coins |
| **6** (Greater Magic) | +1,500 coins | +10,000 coins | +15,000 coins | +15,000 coins | +30,000 coins | +10,000 coins |
| **7** (Superior Magic) | +5,000 coins | +30,000 coins | +50,000 coins | +50,000 coins | +100,000 coins | +30,000 coins |
| **8** (Supreme Magic) | +15,000 coins | +100,000 coins | +150,000 coins | +150,000 coins | +300,000 coins | +100,000 coins |
| **8** (Supreme Magic) | +15,000 coins | +100,000 coins | +150,000 coins | +150,000 coins | +300,000 coins | +75,000 coins |

## Magic Item Effects

### Magic Weapons and Spell Catalysts

Magic weapons and spell catalysts increase their weapon or spell damage by +1 for each step above their original Quality respectively and increases their innate Durability. The following table describes the exact bonuses magic weapons and spell catalysts gain. Quality 3 is a special case, where the items count as non-magical masterworks but follow the same principle.

| Quality | Weapon/Spell Damage | Durability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3* | +1/+0* | - |
| 4 | +1 | +1d |
| 5 | +2 | +1d |
| 6 | +3 | +2d |
| 7 | +4 | +2d |
| 8 | +5 | +3d |

> Weapons which are already Quality 3 in their mundane form can also be made as masterwork versions for the extra cost but only to gain access to a masterwork property. Such weapons **don’t** get an increase to their weapon damage as their base form is already of the same Quality.
>

### Magic Armor, Shields, and Helmets

Masterwork armor, shields, and helmets increase their defensive capabilities with increased Quality. These higher Quality pieces are only available at minimum Quality 4 in contrast to weapons.

> Shields are treated as both weapons and armor for the benefits of masterwork items. This means that a Quality 4 light shield will both increase it’s weapon damage from 2 to 3 and it’s AV bonus from 1 to 2. Bucklers also gain the magic item AV bonus, although they don’t grant one in their mundane form.
>

| Quality | AV Bonus | Durability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | +1 | +1d |
| 5 | +2 | +1d |
| 6 | +3 | +2d |
| 7 | +4 | +2d |
| 8 | +5 | +3d |

### Magic Ammo

Ranged attacks with magic ammo deal extra damage on a hit. This bonus does not count towards weapon damage but gives a flat damage bonus depending on it's Quality. Magic ammo names include the bonus suffix (e.g., "Arrows +2" for Q4).

Magic ammo comes as units of supply, the same way mundane ammo does. The exception are enchanted pieces of ammo, which are further described below.

| Quality | Damage Bonus |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | +1 |
| 4 | +2 |
| 5 | +3 |
| 6 | +4 |
| 7 | +5 |
| 8 | +6 |

#### Enchanted Ammo

In contrast to weapons and armor, magic ammo normally doesn‘t have an enchantment. You can still buy or craft enchanted pieces of ammo, but they come in individual pieces per use. So one item slot for enchanted ammo with up to three uses represents up to three physical pieces of that ammo. Usually, once such a piece of ammo has successfully hit it‘s target or otherwise activated it‘s enchantment, it is destroyed and you have to spend 1 use for it.

> One item slot with up to three pieces of enchanted ammo costs the same amount of coins as one normal stack of magic ammo of the same Quality. So for example, 3 pieces of Q4 exploding arrows +1 cost 315 coins (15 + 150 + 150). In the same way, one stack of normal Q4 magic arrows costs 165 coins but comes with three full uses as supply instead.
>
> Enchanted ammo still gains the same damage bonus for it‘s Quality as regular magic ammo.

### Spell Scrolls

Spell scrolls contain sacred words or ancient arcane symbols written with magical ink. These magical inscriptions contain single uses of specific spells, which any intelligent creature can read aloud to invoke the spell's effect, after which the scroll turns to dust.

**Casting for Spellcasters:** Reciting the inscription always requires an Action. If you have learned Arcana or Mysticism for arcane or mystic spell scrolls respectively, you can cast the spell normally without paying its Focus cost (you can't use any Metamagic Arts with it).

**Casting for Non-Spellcasters:** If you haven't learned the appropriate magical skill, the scroll itself empowers you with the knowledge to cast it. Use the attribute dice and skill bonus provided by the scroll's Quality tier when making any tests required to cast the spell.

**Crafting Spell Scrolls:** When creating a spell scroll yourself, you must have learned the talent "Spell Scribe", be able to cast the chosen spell, and pay half the scroll's cost during the given amount of downtime. Spell scrolls have 0 load.

| Quality | Spell Rank | Attribute Die | Skill Bonus | Cost | Crafting Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 (Faint) | 0 | d6 | +1 | 50 coins | 1 hour |
| 4 (Lesser) | 1 | d8 | +1 | 150 coins | 1 day |
| 5 (Potent) | 2 | d10 | +2 | 500 coins | 1 week |
| 6 (Greater) | 3 | d10 | +3 | 1,500 coins | 2 weeks |
| 7 (Superior) | 4 | d12 | +4 | 5,000 coins | 4 weeks |
| 8 (Supreme) | 5 | d12 | +5 | 15,000 coins | 8 weeks |

**Random Scrolls**: Roll to determine scroll type and spell discipline/tradition:

| d6 | Scroll Type | | d6 | Arcane Spell Discipline | | d8 | Mystic Spell Tradition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1-3 | arcane spell | | 1 | Evocation | | 1 | Light |
| 4-6 | mystic spell | | 2 | Illusion | | 2 | Twilight |
|  |  | | 3 | Conjuration | | 3 | Life |
|  |  | | 4 | Telepathy | | 4 | Death |
|  |  | | 5 | Telekinetics | | 5 | Nature |
|  |  | | 6 | Necromancy | | 6 | Tempest |
|  |  |  |  | | | 7 | Peace |
|  |  |  |  | | | 8 | War |

# Materials & Enchantments

Every magic item must be crafted from a material, and may optionally have an enchantment applied to it.

## Materials

All items are crafted from materials that determine their construction, durability, and appearance.

### Material Categories

**Primitive Materials (Q1).** Primitive materials are cheap, makeshift alternatives. Items made from Q1 materials are functional but fragile and more likely to break. They exist to represent low-tech or improvised equipment and are typically limited to low-cost items.

**Mundane Materials (Q2).** Q2 is the default material tier for mundane items. These are the everyday, well-made materials (bronze, leather, hardwood) used across settlements.

**Magical Materials (Q3+).** Required for all magic items. These are mundane materials magically infused during forging, or natural materials from spiritually-charged locations (ancient groves, meteor impacts, mana-rich veins). They provide the foundation for magic items but grant no further mechanical properties on their own.

**Special Materials (Optional).** Specific named materials like Mithril, Adamantite, or Dragon Scales. These provide unique mechanical benefits beyond standard quality bonuses.

> **Example Comparison**
>
> - **Q5 bronze longsword**: Masterfully crafted bronze. Gains +2 damage and +1d durability. No extra cost.
> - **Q5 magic longsword +2**: Requires magical materials. Costs 50 (base) + 3,000 (magic item base cost) = 3,050 coins.
> - **Q5 adamantite longsword +2**: Uses special material. Costs 50 (base) + 3,000 (magic base) + 1,500 (special material) = 4,550 coins.

### Materials - Primitive (Q1)

Crude makeshift items for tribes without better materials.

| d8 | Material | Properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Bone** | *Sourced from beasts or humanoids. Lightweight but brittle; breaks under strong impacts.*<br/><br/>The item gains the fragile property. |
| 2 | **Copper** | *Soft reddish metal. Easy to shape, but poor durability for weapons or armor.*<br/><br/>The item gains the fragile property. |
| 3 | **Fresh Wood** | *Cut from living trees without drying or treatment. Warps easily and lacks strength.*<br/><br/>The item gains the fragile property. |
| 4 | **Stone** | *Rough, heavy, and crude. Can be shaped into tools or weapons, but prone to chipping.*<br/><br/>The item gains the fragile property. |
| 5 | **Flint** | *Sharp when fractured. Good for cutting edges but extremely brittle.*<br/><br/>The item gains the fragile property. |
| 6 | **Bark** | *Flexible but weak. Used for basic armor or bindings, mostly ceremonial or temporary.*<br/><br/>The item gains the fragile property. |
| 7 | **Reed** | *Hollow and very light. Used for simple shafts or padding, but offers no real durability.*<br/><br/>The item gains the fragile property. |
| 8 | **Shell** | *Hard outer layer from aquatic creatures. Smooth and rigid, but fragile under pressure.*<br/><br/>The item gains the fragile property. |

### Materials - Mundane (Q2-Q8)

Standard materials available at all quality tiers.

| d8 | Material | Properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Brass** | *Yellow-gold alloy. Decorative and corrosion-resistant, but not ideal for combat use.* **No mechanical effect.** |
| 2 | **Bronze** | *Standard metal for tools and weapons. Balanced in strength, weight, and workability.* **No mechanical effect.** |
| 3 | **Hardwood** | *Dense, seasoned wood. Durable and shock-absorbent; used for bows, clubs, and shields.* **No mechanical effect.** |
| 4 | **Leather** | *Treated animal skin. Flexible, provides basic protection; common for light armor.* **No mechanical effect.** |
| 5 | **Horn** | *Solid, curved keratin. Used for weapon hilts, tips, and decorative armor parts.* **No mechanical effect.** |
| 6 | **Hide** | *Thick, untreated skin. Tougher than leather, but less flexible.* **No mechanical effect.** |
| 7 | **Antler** | *Hard and naturally curved. Effective for piercing weapons or rugged tools.* **No mechanical effect.** |
| 8 | **Obsidian** | *Volcanic mineral which can be crafted into very sharp razor blades, though extremely brittle and easily breaking.*<br/><br/>The item gains the fragile property. Weapon/Ammo: +1 weapon damage (enhancement bonus). |

### Materials - Exotic (Q3-Q4)

Unusual, monster-based, or mildly magical materials. Quite rare and often region-specific.

| d10 | Material | Properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Chitin** | *Harvested from insectoid or crustacean monsters. Lighter than metal, but still strong and durable. Used as organic armor plating.*<br/><br/>Armor/Shield: -1 load (min. 0). |

Formula is a guarded secret; known for durability and excellent heat resistance.*<br/><br/>Any: Once per day, you can re-roll a Durability check for this item.<br/>Heavy Armor: You don't suffer a penalty for wearing heavy armor in extreme climates. |
| 9 | **Darkwood** | *Dark wood with a mix of red and basalt layers that is much lighter than normal wood and resistant like metal. Often used for wooden weapons or shields. Has no effect on weapons only partially made of wood.*<br/><br/>Weapon/Shield/Ammo: -1 load (min. 0). |
| 10 | **Wyrmhide** | *Thick hide from lesser draconic creatures. Offers slight protection against elemental damage.*<br/><br/>Armor/Shield: Once per scene, gain resistance against any single damage source dealing acid, fire, frost, lightning, or poison damage. |

### Materials - Greater (Q5-Q6)

Epic materials with potent magical properties. Rare and sought-after, these are used to craft powerful weapons and armor that offer substantial advantages.

| d10 | Material | Properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Meteorite** | *Blue-silver metal found in fallen stars. Imbued with natural magical energy. Some cultures revere or fear it due to its otherworldly origin.* |
| 2 | **Treantwood** | *Harvested from awakened trees. Tough and slightly regenerative, reacts to magic.* |
| 3 | **Dragon Bone** | *Bones from dragons carry elemental properties tied to their nature. Very strong and magically reactive. Used in powerful weapons or armor.* |

| 7 | **Mithril** | *Lightweight, silvery metal. High durability with very low weight; ideal for fast fighters.*<br/><br/>Armor/Shield: -1 load (min. 0). Reduce the item's rigid property by 1 (min. 0). |
| 8 | **Solarite** | *Red-gold crystal found on celestial mountain peaks. Mixed with bronze in a ritual to create a glowing, heat-reactive alloy. Generates intense heat when moved quickly.* |
| 9 | **Lunarite** | *Deep blue crystal found in underworld caverns. Absorbs magical energy. Used in armor to resist spells or in restraints to suppress magic.* |
| 10 | **Adamantite** | *Extremely hard and dense metal. Almost impossible to break or bend.* |

### Materials - Legendary (Q7-Q8)

Cosmic, divine, or artifact-tier materials. Extremely rare and often unique, these are reserved for legendary artifacts and items of world-shaping power.

| d10 | Material | Properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Orichalcum** | *Light-blue metal that is nearly weightless. Enchanted during forging to retain high flexibility and hardness. Very rare and extremely valuable.* |

| 10 | **Infernal Horn** | *Taken from powerful infernal beasts. Resistant to heat and can channel demonic energy.* |

## Enchantments

Enchantments are optional magical properties for items of Q4+. Each enchantment adds its full cost to the item (see Enchantment Cost table).

### Enchanting items

Any non-enchanted item of Quality 3 or higher can be enchanted. Magic items can only hold one enchantment, unless they are exceptionally powerful items found during adventures. Crafting an enchantment requires:

- an enchanter capable of creating magical items,
- the appropriate ritual during downtime, and
- magical ingredients worth at least half the enchantment's cost.

Removing an enchantment is difficult and often destroys the item.

> **Stacking**
>
> If multiple equipped items provide the same enchantment effect, only the highest effect applies. This covers passive and stat effects; active abilities that require an Action or Quick Action are not blocked by this rule. Example: boots of reflexes +1 and cloak of reflexes +2 both grant Dodge — only the +2 applies.

> **Prefix vs. Suffix**
>
> Enchantment effects come in two forms, as a prefix or a suffix to the base items name.
>
> - Prefix enchantments grant active or triggered abilities (common on weapons, catalysts, armor, and shields).
> - Suffix enchantments grant passive bonuses (wearables always use suffixes). Enchanted ammo uses prefix enchantments. If a suffix is needed for a non-wearable item, roll on the wearable table.
> 
> If a randomly rolled enchantment is not compatible with an item, re-roll.

> **Scaling by Quality**
>
> Each enchantment lists the Qualities where it appears; numeric variables scale with Quality. For example, "of Protection" at Q4 = +1 AV, Q5 = +2 AV, Q6 = +3 AV. Note that some enchantments are not available for all tiers of Quality.

### Ammo Enchantments

| d6 | Prefix |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **burning (Q4/Q5/Q6).** This projectile ignites itself when fired. On a hit, inflict burning (4/6/8) to the target. |
| 2 | **draining (Q5).** On a hit, the target is briefly stunned. You can only use this effect once per scene against any individual target. |
| 3 | **ensnaring (Q4/Q5/Q6).** On hit, magical vines erupt from the projectile to entangle the target. A large or smaller target is grappled by the vines. The target’s rolls to escape the grapple are made vs. medium/hard/very hard Difficulty (8/10/12). |
| 4 | **shattering (Q4/Q5/Q6).** On a hit, the projectile explodes into a loud bang, dealing 4/6/8 blast damage (ignoring AV) to the target and each other creature within melee range of them. On a strong or critical hit, the target is also knocked prone. |
| 5 | **seeking (Q4/Q6).** This shot curves unnaturally toward its mark. Ignore any penalties from range or cover and gain +1 boon on this attack. At Q6, you can also target creatures behind full cover, as long as there is a possible flight path for the projectile and you are aware of their location. |
| 6 | **wounding (Q4/Q5/Q6).** On a hit, inflict bleeding (4/6/8) on the target. You can only use this effect once per scene against any individual target. |

### Weapon Enchantments

| d12 | Prefix |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **bloody (Q4/Q5/Q6).** On a strong or critical hit with this weapon, inflict bleeding (2/4/6) on the target. If your hit would inflict bleeding already, increase the amount by +2/+4/+6 instead. |
| 2 | **booming (Q4/Q5/Q6).** On a hit with this weapon, you can choose to deal blast damage instead. On a strong or critical hit, the target is also pushed a close/short/medium distance.<br/>You can use this ability once/twice/thrice per day. |
| 3 | **defiled (Q4/Q5/Q6).** This weapon is tainted with dark energy, causing nearby plants to slowly wither and exuding a faint aura of malevolence. You can use your Quick Action on your turn to amplify this corruption for a short duration.<br/>While amplified, the weapon turns bright light to dim light in close range and deals 2/4/6 necrotic damage (ignoring AV) on a hit. |
| 4 | **flaming (Q4/Q5/Q6).** While holding this weapon, you can use your Quick Action on your turn to ignite it with flames for a short duration.<br/>While ignited, the weapon emits bright light in melee range, dim light in close range, and deals 2/4/6 fire damage (ignoring AV) on a hit. |
| 5 | **infused (Q4/Q5/Q6).** While holding this weapon, you can use your Quick Action on your turn to regain 4/6/8 Focus. You can use this ability once per day. |
| 6 | **morphing (Q4).** Choose any second type of weapon. When applying this enchantment during crafting, you must use and destroy that weapon (at least masterwork quality) as part of the enchanting process.<br/>This weapon combines both weapon forms into one, stretching or contracting it's parts upon activation to assume a different shape. If you speak the command word as a Quick Action, the weapon transforms from one of it's forms into the other one. The weapon retains all mundane and magical properties of the original weapons when their respective shape is used.<br/>**Cost:** Add both base item costs and material extra costs together, but pay the enchantment cost only once. Example: Q4 bronze shortsword/longbow = 50 + 0 + 100 + 0 + 1,000 = 1,150 coins. |
| 7 | **poisoner's (Q4/Q6).** When applying any type of poison to this weapon, add +2/+4 to any poison damage it deals (for weapon poisons) or increase the difficulty to end the poisons effect by one/two step(s) (for paralyzing poisons). |
| 8 | **returning (Q4).** After using a short break to attune yourself to it, the weapon becomes magically linked to your person. It gains the thrown (short/medium) property.

### Special Material Trade Values

Special materials are valuable trade goods that can be bought, sold, or harvested from creatures. Their value is based on quality tier, with prices listed per load.

#### Cost per Load

| Quality | Cost per Load |
| --- | --- |
| **Q3** | 450 coins |
| **Q4** | 1,500 coins |
| **Q5** | 4,500 coins |
| **Q6** | 15,000 coins |
| **Q7** | 45,000 coins |
| **Q8** | 150,000 coins |

#### Material Required by Item Type

Different item types require different amounts of material to craft:

- **One-handed weapons/spell catalysts**: 1 load
- **Two-handed/heavy weapons**: 2 loads
- **Light armor/shields/helmets**: 2 loads
- **Heavy armor**: 4 loads
- **Wearables**: 0.5 loads
- **Ammo/consumables**: 0.25 loads

**Total material cost** = Cost per load × loads required

> Example: Q6 dragon scales cost 15,000 coins per load. Heavy armor requires 4 loads, so crafting Q6 dragon scale heavy armor requires 60,000 coins worth of materials (4 × 15,000). A one-handed weapon needs only 1 load = 15,000 coins of material.

**Harvesting:** Use the creature harvesting rules to determine what materials can be obtained from defeated monsters. The quality tier of harvested materials typically matches the creature's challenge level.
