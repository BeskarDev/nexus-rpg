# 💎 Magic Items

![banner-img](/img/banner/weapon-armor-materials-banner.png)

Magic items are higher Quality versions of normal weapons, armor, or other equipment. These items come with higher bonuses than their mundane counterparts but also with a much higher price and skill required to craft them. Typically, high quality magical materials are required to craft magic items.

Magic items increase the numerical bonuses of their base item type and also come with a variety of enchantments and special materials. Most magic items will either be made from a special material or have an enchantment. Some especially rare ones will have both.

To calculate the prices of magic items, apply the following price modifier depending on the Quality of the magic item and the item’s type. These prices assume either a magic item made from a special material or with an enchantment. For items with both a special material and an enchantment on top, apply the magic item price modifier twice instead.

> For example, a mundane shortsword is Quality 2 and costs 50 coins. A Quality 3 masterwork shortsword +1 would instead cost 350 coins (50 + 300), because the shortsword is a one-handed weapon. A Quality 5 magic shortsword +2 would cost 3,050 coins instead (50 + 3,000). A Quality 5 magic breastplate +2 would cost 10,750 coins (750 + 10,000) because it is heavy armor.
A Quality 6 magic longsword made from a special material and with an enchantment costs 20,100 coins (100 + 2 x 10,000).

## Magic Item Cost per Quality Tier

| Quality | Ammo / Consumables | One-handed Weapon / Spell Catalyst | Two-handed or Heavy Weapon | Light Armor / Shield / Helmet | Heavy Armor | Wearable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **3** (Masterwork) | +50 coins | +300 coins | +500 coins | +500 coins | +1,000 coins | +250 coins |
| **4** (Lesser Magic) | +150 coins | +1,000 coins | +1,500 coins | +1,500 coins | +3,000 coins | +750 coins |
| **5** (Potent Magic) | +500 coins | +3,000 coins | +5,000 coins | +5,000 coins | +10,000 coins | +2,500 coins |
| **6** (Greater Magic) | +1,500 coins | +10,000 coins | +15,000 coins | +15,000 coins | +30,000 coins | +7,500 coins |
| **7** (Superior Magic) | +5,000 coins | +30,000 coins | +50,000 coins | +50,000 coins | +100,000 coins | +25,000 coins |
| **8** (Supreme Magic) | +15,000 coins | +100,000 coins | +150,000 coins | +150,000 coins | +300,000 coins | +75,000 coins |

### Wearable Equipment Base Costs

When creating magic wearable items for different equipment slots, use these minimum base costs before applying the magic item price modifiers above:

| Equipment Slot | Min. Base Cost |
| --- | --- |
| **Head** (helmet, headband, mask) | 50 coins |
| **Neck** (amulet, brooch, scarf) | 50 coins |
| **Back** (cape, cloak, mantle) | 100 coins |
| **Body** (robe, tunic) | 100 coins |
| **Hands** (bracers, bracelets, gloves) | 50 coins |
| **Rings** | 50 coins |
| **Waist** (belt, sash, girdle) | 50 coins |
| **Feet** (boots, sandals, shoes) | 100 coins |

> For example, a Quality 4 **amulet of protection** would cost 800 coins total (50 base cost + 750 wearable magic item modifier). A Quality 5 **cloak of strength** would cost 2,600 coins (100 base cost + 2,500 wearable magic item modifier).
> 

## Magic Item Effects

### Magic Weapons and Spell Catalysts

Masterwork weapons and spell catalysts increase their weapon or spell damage by +1 for each step above their original Quality respectively and increases their innate Durability. The following table describes the exact bonuses masterwork or magic weapons and spell catalysts gain.

| Quality | Weapon/Spell Damage | Durability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3* | +1/+0* | - |
| 4 | +1 | +1d |
| 5 | +2 | +1d |
| 6 | +3 | +2d |
| 7 | +4 | +2d |
| 8 | +5 | +3d |

> * Weapons which are already Quality 3 in their mundane form can also be made as masterwork versions for the extra cost but only to gain access to a masterwork property. Such weapons **don’t** get an increase to their weapon damage as their base form is already of the same Quality.
> 

### Magic Armor, Shields, and Helmets

Masterwork armor, shields, and helmets increase their defensive capabilities with increased Quality. These higher Quality pieces are only available at minimum Quality 4 in contrast to weapons, which are already available from Quality 3.

> Shields are treated as both weapons and armor for the benefits of masterwork items. This means that a Quality 4 light shield will both increase it’s weapon damage from 2 to 3 and it’s AV bonus from 1 to 2. Bucklers also gain the masterwork’s AV bonus, although they don’t grant one in their mundane form.
> 

| Quality | AV Bonus | Durability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | +1 | +1d |
| 5 | +2 | +1d |
| 6 | +3 | +2d |
| 7 | +4 | +2d |
| 8 | +5 | +3d |

### Magic Ammo

Ranged attacks with magic ammo deal extra damage on a hit. This damage bonus does not count towards weapon damage but gives a flat damage bonus depending on it‘s Quality.

Magic ammo comes as units of supply, the same way mundane ammo does. The exception are enchanted pieces of ammo, which are further described below.

| Quality | Damage Bonus |
| --- | --- |
| 3 | +1 |
| 4 | +2 |
| 5 | +3 |
| 6 | +4 |
| 7 | +5 |
| 8 | +6 |

#### **Enchanted Ammo**

In contrast to weapons and armor, magic ammo normally doesn‘t have an enchantment. You can still buy or craft enchanted pieces of ammo, but they come in individual pieces per use. So one item slot for enchanted ammo with up to three uses represents up to three physical pieces of that ammo. Usually, once such a piece of ammo has successfully hit it‘s target or otherwise activated it‘s enchantment, it is destroyed and you have to spend 1 use for it.

One item slot with up to three pieces of enchanted ammo costs the same amount of coins as one normal stack of magic ammo of the same Quality. So for example, 3 pieces of Q4 exploding arrows cost 165 coins (15 + 150). In the same way, one stack of normal Q4 magic arrows also costs 165 coins but comes with three full uses as supply instead.

Enchanted ammo still gains the same damage bonus for it‘s Quality as regular magic ammo.

### Spell Scrolls

Spell scrolls contain sacred words or ancient arcane symbols written with magical ink. These magical inscriptions contain single uses of specific spells, which any intelligent creature can read aloud to invoke the spell’s effect, after which the scroll turns to dust.

Reciting the inscription always requires an Action. If you have learned Arcana or Mysticism for arcane or mystic spell scrolls respectively, you can cast the spell normally without paying it’s Focus cost (you can’t use any Metamagic Arts with it).
If you haven’t, roll a Mind/Spirit + Lore check for arcane or mystic spell scrolls respectively to cast the spell. If you haven’t learned Lore either, you suffer +1 bane on this roll.

Below are the cost of spell scrolls for each spell rank. Spell scrolls have 0 load. When creating a spell scroll yourself, you must have learned the talent “Spell Scribe”, be able to cast the chosen spell, and pay half the scroll’s cost during the given amount of downtime.

| Quality | Spell Rank | Cost | Crafting Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 (Faint) | 0 | 50 coins | 1 hour |
| 4 (Lesser) | 1 | 150 coins | 1 day |
| 5 (Potent) | 2 | 500 coins | 1 week |
| 6 (Greater) | 3 | 1,500 coins | 2 weeks |
| 7 (Superior) | 4 | 5,000 coins | 4 weeks |
| 8 (Supreme) | 5 | 15,000 coins | 8 weeks |

# Special Materials & Enchantments

## Enchantments

Enchanted items include weapons, armor, and other mostly wearable equipment with magical properties and can have a variety of effects depending on their type and potency. Which enchantment an item has is denoted by it’s name. Roll on the table below to determine which type of enchantments the item has. Then roll on the corresponding tables for weapons, armor, etc.

#### **Enchanting items**

Any non-enchanted item with Quality 3 or higher can be enchanted. This requires a craftsperson with the ability to create enchanted items, a magical ritual during downtime, and adequately potent magical ingredients. The enchantments cost depends on it’s Quality the same way as the magic item cost above, where ingredients worth at least half that cost need to be provided.

Removing an existing enchantment from an item is no easy feat and often results in destroying the item with it.

#### **Stacking enchantments**

You might come into possession of multiple magic items which provide the same type of benefit with their enchantments. In this case, you can only ever benefit from one source of any kind of enchantment that would affect the same statistics. If you wear or wield multiple items which grant the same kind of enchantment, only the highest benefit applies. This restriction applies for both increases to your statistics, as well as for triggered abilities. An exception are active abilities, which require you to use an Action, Quick Action, or other time interval to activate the item’s effect. Any lasting effect still can be only applied once on a target.

> For example, you wear both a pair of “boots of reflexes +1” and a “cloak of reflexes +2”. Both items would grant you a bonus to your Dodge statistic (+1 and +2 respectively). But because they provide the same kind of enchantment, you can only benefit from one of their effects. In this case, only the effect of the “cloak of reflexes +2” would grant it’s bonus.
> 

#### **Determining Enchantments**

In general, [prefix] enchantments apply active or triggered abilities to the item, while [suffix] enchantments add passive bonuses or increases to the wearer’s statistics.

Most weapons, spell catalysts, armor, and shields will have [prefix] enchantments and have their own specific tables for those enchantments. Enchanted ammo always has a [prefix] enchantment. Wearable items on the other hand will **always** have a [suffix] enchantment. When choosing a [suffix] enchantment for any non-wearable type of item, roll on the table for wearable enchantments.

> For example, an enchanted item with the name “[prefix] [item]” could be a “flaming greatsword” or a “stalward scale mail”, whereas an item with the name “[item] [suffix]” could be an “amulet of willpower” or a “spear of the guardian”.
If an item also is made from a special material, it could be named something like “flaming dragon bone longsword” or “adamantite breastplate of fortitude”.
> 

When randomly determining a magic item’s enchantment and you get a result not available for the item, re-roll until you get a compatible result.

#### **Enchantments per Quality**

In each enchantment description, you will find in which Qualities they are available. The list of Qualities in the enchantments name also correlates to any scaling numbers in the effect. So for example, the enchantment “[item] of Protection” is available for Quality 4 or higher. At Quality 4, the item provides +1 AV. The Quality 5 version would grant +2 AV, the Quality 6 version +3 AV, and so on. Some enchantments can also have multiple variables scaling with their Quality or skip some available levels of Quality for powerful effects.
