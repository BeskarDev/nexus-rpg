# 🎒 Items, Equipment & Encumbrance

## Coins

Adventurers amass wealth in the abstracted form of coins over their adventures. While this wealth is denoted in coins, it is an abstraction which also includes other groups of valuables fit for barter:

- Actual Coins (*local, foreign, or ancient*)
- Currency (*metal bars, certificates, stocks*)
- Gems (*rough, cut, pulverized*)
- Art Objects (*paintings, jewelry, sculptures, decorated items, clothes, dishes, instruments, clockworks*)
- Books/Scrolls (*poetry, story, magical, religious, nature, political, historical, geographical*)

- Creature Parts (*furs, hides, bones, organs, scales, secretions*)
- Trade Goods (*beverages, spices, cosmetics, perfumes, dyes, lumber, metals, textiles*)
- Alchemy (*alchemical items, potions, oils, herbs*)
- Crafting Materials (*recipes, formulas, materials, magical ingredients*)
- Items (*tools, gear, supplies, weapons, armor, magic items*)

One coin is the cost of a bag of grain, a simple meal at a market, or the daily pay of an unskilled laborer.

> The amount of coins an adventurer carries around with them takes up no load. But note, that any found treasure does take up a varying amount of load, depending on what assortment of items the treasure consists of. Only once the adventurers successfully bring the treasure back into an appropriately sized settlement and take some downtime there, are they able to add their won treasure to their wealth of coins (more details under the “Sell Treasure” Activity in the Downtime section).

## Items

You can buy, sell, and find a variety of items that are useful for your adventures.

### Item Quality
An item’s Quality determines how hard is it to create, find, and how much it is worth.

> Note that the worth of consumable items is treated as one Quality lower.

## Tools

When you have a tool in your possession that would help you accomplish a roll you are about to attempt, gain +1 boon on the roll. This roll has to be possible without the tool, otherwise, it just enables the roll but doesn’t grant the boon. You can only benefit from one tool per roll.

## Supply

Supplies are consumable goods, that are not tracked as normal equipment. Instead, each type of supply has an associated Resource Die between d4 (1 unit) and d12 (5 units), where a d12 or 5 units is the most amount one person can physically take with them. At certain points during the game, you will have to roll your Resource Die. When you roll a 1 or 2, reduce your Resource Die by one step. Instead of reducing a d4 Resource Die, you consume all your remaining supply of that type.

Each Supply’s load always remains the same, regardless of its Resource Die size. For example, when you carry provisions in any amount, they always take up 1 load.

### Increasing and Decreasing Supply

When you gain supply, increase its Resource Die by one step for each unit. Buying supplies is done unit by unit.

When you lose one unit of supply, reduce the supply‘s Resource Die.

### Types of Supply

Supply is grouped into different types that can be used for different purposes during adventures.

**Ammo**

Roll once after a fight, in which you used ammo. You need different types of ammo for different types of ranged weapons.

**Provisions**

Roll once at the end of each day to receive the effects of a night‘s rest. A successful foraging or hunting roll might allow you to re-stock during travel.

**Light**

Roll once every hour or after each exploration turn, while exploring with the light source active.

**Materials**

Common, natural materials for repairing equipment, crafting simple items, building traps, treating wounds, or healing sicknesses. Can be re-stocked during travel by foraging.

**Bundles**

Bundles are a special type of supply. They are foremost weapons but can be used as ammunition for attacking at range. They also include other items, such as alchemical substances. See the description for „bundle“ weapons under the Weapon and Armor Properties for more details.

### Carrying multiple versions of the same type of Supply

The maximum amount of Supply units you can carry are accumulated across each type of supply. For instance, you are only able to carry up to 5 units of ammunition. If you carry 3 units of arrows, you can only carry 2 more units of any type of ammunition (e.g. bolts).

If you carry mixed Supply of the same type (e.g. arrows and bolts), they only take up load once. If they take up different amounts of load, only count the highest one.

## Repairing damaged items

While carrying a crafting kit, you can attempt to repair a damaged item during a night's rest. Roll Mind + Crafting against 6 + the item’s Quality as the difficulty and make a Supply check for materials. On a success, the item is no longer damaged. Destroyed items can‘t be repaired this way and instead require a downtime activity.

# Equipment

Equipment are the types of items that you carry on your person. You can only ever wear one piece of equipment per slot (except up to three rings) and benefit from it’s effects.

## Equipment Slots

- Head (*helmet, headband, mask, …*)
- Neck (*amulet, brooch, scarf, …*)
- Back (*cape, cloak, mantle, …*)
- Body (*armor, robe, tunic, …*)
- Hands (*bracers, bracelets, gloves, …*)
- Rings (up to three)
- Waist (*belt, sash, girdle, …*)
- Feet (*boots, sandals, shoes, …*)

# Encumbrance

Adventurers carry around a lot of equipment and loot. Encumbrance determines the amount of items they can carry with them on their person.

### Carrying Items

Normally any adventurer can only carry what they can hold in their hands, or wear on their body. To be able to carry more items than that, they need containers. Containers are worn items that can hold onto additional items. How many items any container can hold at maximum is determined by the items combined load (see below).

### Item Load

Carrying items accumulate load. Load is an abstracted measurement of weight and size. Once you carry too much load, you are either encumbered or even over-encumbered.

Generally, an item weighting up to 2 kilograms or up to the size of a water melon is considered 1 load. Items weighting up to 1 kilogram or the size of mango are 0.5 load. Smaller items are considered to have 0 load.

All equipment has listed how much load they take up. When determining the load of any 

### Becoming encumbered

An adventurer’s maximum amount of load they can carry without being encumbered is equal to 2 x Strength. Once you carry 3 x Strength in load, you are over-encumbered and can‘t carry any more load. How much you can carry is also affected by your method of storage. These values assume you carry a backpack and enough bags and pouches to store your items.

| Strength | Encumbrance Limit | Over-Encumbrance Limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| d4 | 8 load | 12 load |
| d6 | 12 load | 18 load |
| d8 | 16 load | 24 load |
| d10 | 20 load | 30 load |
| d12 | 24 load | 36 load |

Being encumbered or over-encumbered causes several effects.

**Encumbered.** You suffer +1 bane on Strength or Agility rolls for movement, such as climbing or swimming, and during travel.

**Over-Encumbered.** You can‘t move. You can‘t use any Actions or do any rolls for physical activity.
