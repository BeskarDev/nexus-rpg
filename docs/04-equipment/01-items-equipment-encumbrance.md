# 🎒 Items, Equipment & Encumbrance

## Coins

Adventurers amass wealth in the abstracted form of coins over their adventures. While this wealth is denoted in coins, it is an abstraction which also includes other groups of valuables fit for barter:

- Actual Coins (*local, foreign, or ancient*)
- Currency (*metal bars, certificates, stocks*)
- Gems (*rough, cut, pulverized*)
- Art Objects (*paintings, jewelry, sculptures, decorated items, clothes, dishes, instruments, clockworks*)
- Books/Scrolls (*poetry, story, magical, religious, nature, political, historical, geographical*)

- Creature Parts (*furs, hides, bones, organs, scales, secretions*)
- Trade Goods (*beverages, spices, cosmetics, perfumes, dyes, lumber, metals, textiles*)
- Alchemy (*alchemical items, potions, oils, herbs*)
- Crafting Materials (*recipes, formulas, materials, magical ingredients*)
- Items (*tools, gear, supplies, weapons, armor, magic items*)

One coin is the cost of a bag of grain, a simple meal at a market, or the daily pay of an unskilled laborer.

> The amount of coins an adventurer carries around with them takes up no load. But note, that any found treasure does take up a varying amount of load, depending on what assortment of items the treasure consists of. Only once the adventurers successfully bring the treasure back into an appropriately sized settlement and take some downtime there, are they able to add their won treasure to their wealth of coins (more details under the “Sell Treasure” Activity in the Downtime section).

## Items

You can buy, sell, and find a variety of items that are useful for your adventures.

### Item Quality

An item’s Quality determines how hard is it to create, find, and how much it is worth.

> Note that the worth of consumable items is treated as one Quality lower.

## Tools

When you have a tool in your possession that would help you accomplish a roll you are about to attempt, gain +1 boon on the roll. This roll has to be possible without the tool, otherwise, it just enables the roll but doesn’t grant the boon. You can only benefit from one tool per roll.

## Supply

Supply items are consumable goods that you can buy in larger quantities. Supply items all come with a Resource Die between 1d4 and 1d12. These dice represent an abstract amount of individual units of that supply that you carry with you.

Different moments during gameplay will call for a Supply check for different types of supply items. When doing so, roll the current Resource Die for your Supply. If your roll a 1 or a 2, reduce the Resource Die of your supply by one step. If you would have to reduce a d4, instead denote a “1”. This means you have one last unit of that supply left. When you would have to make a Supply check for any supply item you only have “1” left, you automatically use up your last unit of that supply and remove it from your inventory.

> As an example, if you carry “torches (d6)” as supply, it means you carry multiple torches with you. After using one of these torches for some time, you will have to make a Supply check with it’s resource die. If you roll a 1 or a 2 on that Supply check, decrease your supply’s Resource Die to d4. This indicates, that you are slowly using up your stock of torches, without having to track each individual torch.
> 

### Average Uses per Resource Die size

| Resource Die | Remaining Uses |
| --- | --- |
| d12 | 20 |
| d10 | 14 |
| d8 | 9 |
| d6 | 5 |
| d4 | 2 |
| 1 | 1 |

### Item Load for Supply

Each supply item takes up load, the same as any other item. The only difference is that you don’t change the supply’s load when you change it’s Resource Die.

### Carrying multiple stacks of Supply

When you wish to carry more units of any type of supply, you can do so by acquiring more of it as separate supply items. Each individual supply item has it’s own Resource Die and load it takes up. Whenever you have to make a Supply check while carrying multiple of the same supply items, roll for the individual supply item with the lowest current Resource Die (or choose one between them, if multiple supply items have the same Resource Die).

### Restocking Supply

If you don’t want to buy a whole new stack, you can fill up any supply item with a reduced Resource Die for half the normal price of that supply item. This resets the supply item’s Resource Die back to it’s starting size.

### Types of Supply

Supply is grouped into different types that can be used for different purposes during adventures.

**Ammo**

Roll once after a fight, in which you used ammo. You need different types of ammo for different types of ranged weapons.

**Rations**

Roll once at the end of each day to receive the effects of a night‘s rest. A successful foraging or hunting roll might allow you to re-stock during travel.

**Light**

Roll once every hour or after each exploration turn, while exploring with the light source active.

**Materials**

Common, natural materials for repairing equipment, crafting simple items, building traps, treating wounds, or healing sicknesses. Can be re-stocked during travel by foraging.

**Bundles**

Bundles are a special type of supply. They are foremost weapons but can be used as ammunition for attacking at range. They also include other items, such as alchemical substances. See the description for „bundle“ weapons under the Weapon and Armor Properties for more details.

## Item Durability

Each item has a Durability die associated with it, representing it’s hardness and resistance to being damage or destroyed. See the table below to see the Durability die of all kinds of items and equipment. Note, that special materials and enchantments can modify an item’s original Durability die.

| Item Type Examples | Durability Die |
| --- | --- |
| glass, ceramic, cloth | d4 |
| light or normal weapons, light armor, wood, leather | d6 |
| heavy weapons, heavy armor, metal, stone | d8 |

If you roll a 1 or a 2 with your Durability check, a non-damaged item gets damaged or an already damaged item becomes destroyed. For more details on the effects, see the Weapon & Armor Properties section. You can attempt to repair damaged or destroyed items, as described in the Downtime section.

### Increasing or decreasing Durability

Any effects that increase or decrease Durability will add or remove a number of steps from the item’s Durability die. Reducing Durability lower than a d4 or increasing it above d12 will affect the dice the same as for Attribute die (d4 to d4-1 and d12 to d12+1, modifiers are added or subtracted from the result). Any Durability die can never be decreased below d4-1 or increased above d12+1, as that would make you automatically fail or succeed on Durability checks.

## Repairing damaged items

While carrying a crafting kit, you can attempt to repair a damaged item during a night's rest. Roll Agility/Mind + Crafting against 6 + the item’s Quality as the difficulty and make a Supply check for materials. On a success, the item is no longer damaged. Destroyed items can‘t be repaired this way and instead require a downtime activity to be usable again.

# Equipment

Equipment are the types of items that you carry on your person. You can only ever wear one piece of equipment per slot (except up to three rings) and benefit from it’s effects.

## Equipment Slots

- Head (*helmet, headband, mask, …*)
- Neck (*amulet, brooch, scarf, …*)
- Back (*cape, cloak, mantle, …*)
- Body (*armor, robe, tunic, …*)
- Hands (*bracers, bracelets, gloves, …*)
- Rings (up to three)
- Waist (*belt, sash, girdle, …*)
- Feet (*boots, sandals, shoes, …*)

# Encumbrance

Adventurers carry around a lot of equipment and loot. Encumbrance determines the amount of items they can carry with them on their person.

### Carrying Items

Normally any adventurer can only carry what they can hold in their hands or wear on their body. To be able to carry more items than that, they need containers. Containers are worn items that can hold onto additional items. How many items any container can hold at maximum is determined by the items combined load (see below).

### Item Load

Carrying items accumulate load. Load is an abstracted measurement of weight and size. Once you carry too much load, you are either encumbered or even over-encumbered.

Generally, an item fitting into one hand takes up 1 load. An item requiring two hands to hold takes up 2 load. Items so small, you can fit multiple of them in a single hand take up 0 load, unless you carry enough of them together.

> For example, a shortsword takes up 1 load, while a two-handed greatsword takes up 2 load. A single gem is 0 load, but a bag of multiple dozen gems takes up 1 load.
>

### Becoming encumbered

An adventurer’s maximum amount of load they can carry without being encumbered is equal to Strength + 4. Once you carry 2 x Strength + 4 in load, you are over-encumbered and can‘t carry any more load. How much you can carry is also affected by your method of storage. These values assume you carry a backpack and enough bags and pouches to store your items.

| Strength | Encumbrance Limit | Over-Encumbrance Limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| d4 | 8 load | 12 load |
| d6 | 10 load | 16 load |
| d8 | 12 load | 20 load |
| d10 | 14 load | 24 load |
| d12 | 16 load | 28 load |

Being encumbered or over-encumbered causes several effects.

**Encumbered.** You suffer +1 bane on Strength or Agility rolls for movement, such as climbing or swimming, and during travel. You also can’t take the Dash Action or the Evade Quick Action.

**Over-Encumbered.** You can‘t move. You can‘t use any Actions or do any rolls for physical activity.

### Fighting while encumbered

When carrying a lot of treasure or gear and suddenly a fight erupts, you can choose to drop your backpack and all items within to the ground during your turn without taking an Action.

The backpack can be picked back up or searched for any specific item by using an Action.
