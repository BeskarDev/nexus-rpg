# 🪄 Magic Items & Enchantments

![banner-img](/img/banner/magic-items-banner.png)

## Spell Scrolls

Spell scrolls contain sacred words or ancient arcane symbols written with magical ink. These magical inscriptions contain single uses of specific spells, which any intelligent creature can read aloud to invoke the spell’s effect, after which the scroll turns to dust.

Reciting the inscription always requires an Action. If you have learned Arcana or Mysticism for arcane or mystic spell scrolls respectively, you can cast the spell normally without paying it’s Focus cost (you can’t use any Metamagic Arts with it).
If you haven’t, roll a Mind/Spirit + Lore check for arcane or mystic spell scrolls respectively to cast the spell. If you haven’t learned Lore either, you suffer +1 bane on this roll.

Below are the cost of spell scrolls for each spell rank. Spell scrolls have 0 load. When creating a spell scroll yourself, you must have learned the talent “Spell Scribe”, be able to cast the chosen spell, and pay half the scroll’s cost during the given amount of downtime.

| Quality | Spell Rank | Cost | Crafting Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 (Faint) | 0 | 250 | 1 hour |
| 4 (Potent) | 1 | 1,000 | 1 day |
| 5 (Greater) | 2 | 2,000 | 1 week |
| 6 (Superior) | 3 | 10,000 | 2 weeks |
| 7 (Supreme) | 4 | 50,000 | 4 weeks |

## Enchanted Items

Enchanted items include weapons, armor, and other mostly wearable equipment with magical properties and can have a variety of effects depending on their type and potency. Most items have a single enchantment on them but a rare few possess a combination of two enchantments. Which enchantments an item has is communicated by it’s name. Roll on the table below to determine which type of enchantments the item has. Then roll once for each result on the corresponding tables for weapons, armor, etc.

Any enchanted weapon or Spell Catalyst you find is **always** also treated as a masterwork item.

> You gain the effects of any enchanted item after wearing or carrying it for one Delving turn or more. You can activate the effects of a new enchanted item during a short break, after which you gain it’s benefits.
> 

### Crafting enchanted items

You can apply enchantments to any item after it’s creation, provided it isn’t enchanted already. When enchanting a weapon or Spell Catalyst, it must be of masterwork quality.

Any enchantment you choose for an item increases it’s total cost. This depends on the Quality of the enchantment(s), as show below:

| Quality | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| 4 | +2,000 coins |
| 5 | +10,000 coins |
| 6 | +50,000 coins |
| 7 | +250,000 coins |

### Items with special materials

An item made of a special material, such as mythril or solarite, is always treated as an enchanted item and uses up the [prefix] enchantment slot. It can still be further enchanted with a [suffix] enchantment, unless the material restricts further enchantments.

### Stacking Enchantments

You can only ever benefit from one source of any kind of enchantment with the same name or if multiple would affect the same statistics. If you wear or wield multiple items which grant the same kind of enchantment, choose any one among them to grant their benefit. This restriction applies for both increases to your statistics, as well as for triggered abilities. An exception are active abilities, which require you to use an Action, Quick Action, or other time interval to activate the item’s effect. Any lasting effect still can be only applied once on a target.

> For example, you wear both a pair of “boots of reflexes +1” and a “cloak of reflexes +2”. Both items would grant you a bonus to your Dodge statistic (+1 and +2 respectively). But because they provide the same kind of enchantment, you can only benefit from one of their effects. In this case, choosing the effect of the “cloak of reflexes +2” would grant a higher bonus, whereas the “boots of reflexes +1” would only grant their lower bonus.
> 

### Determining Enchantments

In general, [prefix] enchantments apply active or triggered abilities to the item, while [suffix] enchantments add passive bonuses or increases to a creature’s statistics.

Most weapons, Spell Catalysts, armor, and shields will have [prefix] enchantments and have their own specific tables for those enchantments. Wearable items on the other hand will **always** only have a [suffix] enchantment. When choosing a [suffix] enchantment for any non-wearable type of item, roll on the table for wearable enchantments.

| d12 | Item Name |
| --- | --- |
| 1-5 | [prefix] [item] |
| 6-10 | [item] [suffix] |
| 11-12 | [prefix] [item] [suffix] |

> For example, an enchanted item with the name “[prefix] [item]” could be a “flaming greatsword” or a “mythral scale mail”, whereas an item with the name “[item] [suffix]” could be an “amulet of willpower” or a “spear of the guardian”. An item with two enchantments could be something like a “bloody greataxe of fortitude”.
