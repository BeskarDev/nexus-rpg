## Primitive Weapons

Though most weapons are listed as Quality 2 items, more primitive cultures will also have variants of these weapons that would fit into Quality 1 instead. Any Quality 2 weapon with a cost of 100 coins or lower can also be crafted as a primitive version of it.

Primitive weapons cost 1/2 the normal amount and have the fragile property (see the rules for special materials).
