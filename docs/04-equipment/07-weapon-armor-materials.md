# üíé Weapon & Armor Materials

Weapons and armor can be made out of a variety of materials. While the default materials don‚Äòt alter the item's properties (even if its quality differs from the item's quality), lower or higher-quality materials do. An item's quality is adjusted to that of the special material.

## Ammo from Special Materials

In addition to upgrading the weapon itself, you can also use ammo from special materials for attacks. The cost for one unit of special ammo is equal to half the cost per load of the material.
