# 🎒 Items

![banner-img](/img/banner/equipment-banner.png)

Items includes all types of weapons, armor, or other equipment adventurers can find during their journey. Weapons, armor, gear, and tools are some of the different kinds of items.

## Item Types

**Alchemy**

These items can be produced by skilled alchemists using different plants and substances. Ingesting or applying them to surfaces them can have different effects, either mundane or magical.

**Clothes**

From simple peasant garments to luxurious robes of nobility, different kinds of clothes are both a symbol of social status and occupation. Clothes don’t take up an equipment slot and can be worn in combination with armor.

**Container**

Container items are specialized to hold a certain amount of other items. They can either be wearable containers, such as pouches, backpacks, or potion satchels. Or they are stationary containers, such as large baskets or storage chests. Stationary containers can also be equipped with locks to increase their security.

**Gear**

Most types of mundane items that are useful during adventurers or daily life fall into this category. This also includes different kinds of item kits, which allow you to spend their uses for things like repairing items, treating wounds, or picking locks.

**Supply**

Any kind of consumable item, such as rations, arrows, or torches, falls into this category. Their uses represent the amount of that supply item you still have left.

**Toolkit**

There are different kinds of specialized toolkits which include different items useful for a given profession. For example smith’s tools include a hammer, tongs, charcoal, rags, and a small whetstone. Whenever one of the items in a toolkit would increase your chances to succeed on a given task, you may add +1 boon on the roll. If you do, it is up to the GM if your tool usage requires you to spend a use for your toolkit.

**Trade Good**

These items hold no utilitarian function, but are used for barter and trade. You can sell these items for their full value.

**Transportation**

Carts, wagons, and chariots are included in this category. Similarly to containers, they can be used to store items or transport people. Some can be pulled by a person, others require one or more mounts to be moved.

## Quality

Each item has a Quality rating between 1 (primitive) and 8 (mythical) associated with it.

| Quality | Base Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (**primitive**) | 25 coins | Crafted by primitive tribes or apprentices from common materials. Found even in the humblest villages and wild camps. |
| 2 (**simple**) | 75 coins | Made by novice artisans with basic tools. Common across most civilized lands. |
| 3 (**complex**) | 250 coins | The finest non-magical craftsmanship. Requires expert hands and rare materials. Found in great cities or with adept smiths. |
| 4 (**formidable**) | 750 coins | Forged from naturally magical or enchanted materials. Only expert craftsmen can create such items. Rarely found outside great capitals or secretive mystic enclaves. |
| 5 (**exceptional**) | 2,500 coins | Blends advanced craft with potent magical elements. Rare even in great capitals or enchanted forges. Only rarely found in legendary workshops or powerful strongholds. |
| 6 (**epic**) | 7,500 coins | The limit of mortal craftsmanship in this age. Made with legendary ingredients and deep magical knowledge. Found only in the vaults of powerful lords or gifted by ancient orders. |
| 7 (**legendary**) | 25,000 coins | Beyond the reach of any living craftsman. Forged in mythic ages or by divine hands. Found only in ancient ruins or in the hands of great heroes. |
| 8 (**mythical**) | 75,000 coins | Relics of godly power. Each is steeped in legend and entwined with destiny. Possessed only by the chosen - or those who would defy the gods themselves. |

## Value

Adventurers amass wealth in the abstracted currency of “coins” over their adventures (sometimes abbreviated as “c”). This abstracted currency is assumed to represent the local currency of the region the adventurers are located in, for example “1 coin” or “1c” might be equal in value to “1 silver piece”.

> Generally, items can be sold for half their value. The exception are designated trade goods or gems, which can be sold for their full value.
> 

Here are some examples for how much different items or services are worth:

| Coins | Value of Item or Service |
| --- | --- |
| 1 coin | bag of grain, simple meal, daily pay for unskilled labor |
| 5 coins | a linen pouch, a small wooden tool |
| 10 coins | hemp rope, one night’s stay at the inn |
| 50 coins | pack of adventuring gear, a shortsword |
| 100 coins | a longsword, a spear |
| 500 coins | a suit of armor, a warbow |

### Modifiers to Base Values

While each Quality tier for items describes a base value, different types of items will have their own modifiers for those base values because of their size or complexity. Here are the most common categories with their modifiers to the base value:

- **Supply/Bundle/Ammo:** x0.25
- **Consumable/Tools/Utilities:** x0.5
- **Light Weapons:** x0.75
- **Medium Weapons:** x1.25
- **Heavy/Two-handed Weapons:** x2.0
- **Light Armor/Helmet:** x2.0
- **Heavy Armor:** x3.0
- **Jewelry/Art:** x1.0
- **Mounts/Animals:** x3.0
- **Vehicles:** x5.0

## Load

Carrying around items takes up an abstracted form of encumbrance called “load”. Typically any one item takes up 1 load. Heavy or larger items might take up 2 or more load. Very small items take up 0 load. If multiple pieces of an item (e.g. rations, ammo, or other bundles) come as a unit, the entire unit takes up load, ignoring how many uses of it you have left.

### Carrying Capacity

An adventurer’s max. amount of load they can carry without being encumbered is equal to 1/2 Strength + 8. This number is called your “carrying capacity”. You can never physically carry more than 2 x your carrying capacity.

> While encumbered, you suffer the following effects:
> 
> - You suffer +1 bane on Strength/Agility rolls for any kind of movement (climbing, swimming, jumping, …)
> - You can’t take the Dash Action or the Evade Quick Action
> - Whenever you suffer Fatigue during travel, you suffer +1 Fatigue

| Strength | Carrying Capacity |
| --- | --- |
| d4 | 10 load |
| d6 | 11 load |
| d8 | 12 load |
| d10 | 13 load |
| d12 | 14 load |

### Carrying Items

You are able to carry items in your hands, in a container on your body, or within some kind of external storage (e.g. pack animal, wagon, base camp).

> You can designate up to 4 items on your person as “quick access”, meaning you have them readily available from your belt or or other visible container on your person.
> 

Depending on where you have stored any given item, you might have quick access to it or might require more time and effort to retrieve it:

- **Quick Access.** At the start of your turn, you can retrieve or switch any of these items freely, as long as you have at least one hand free.
- **Carried Container.** Spend an Action to retrieve any one item from your backpack or any other storage container you are in touching range of (e.g. saddle bags of a pack animal).
- **Storage.** This item is located at some stationary place of your choosing (e.g. a house or storage facility) and not on your person during the adventure.

**Storage Options**

You can buy different storage options for your amassed treasure and equipment you collected during your adventures. You can find available options in the Equipment section under Transportation or Housing.

## Usage

Each item has three “uses”. These uses represent an item’s Durability or the remaining amount of a bundle or pack of items (for rations, arrows, throwing knifes, etc.). If all three uses of an item are spend, it is damaged or completely emptied.

There are different ways of how uses are spend:

- If an item takes damage, spend 1 use
- If you spend part of a pack of gear, supplies, or ammo, spend 1 use
- If you produce a specific tool from a toolkit, spend 1 use

> You can repair or refill one use of an item by spending 1/10th of the item’s original cost (rounded up).
> 

### Durability

During different points of any adventure, you will have to make Durability checks for your items. When having to do so, roll the Durability die of your item (e.g. d6 for a normal weapon). If you roll a 1-3, that item takes damage and you have to spend 1 use for it.

Once you spend the last use of any item for Durability, the item becomes damaged (the effects are described under the Weapon & Armor Properties section). If you would ever have to spend 1 use for a damaged item, it becomes broken and can’t be used anymore.

> To repair a broken item during downtime costs 1/2 the item’s original cost (rounded up). You still have to spend further coins to repair the item’s uses.
In the case of a magic item, further efforts might be required to restore it’s magical properties.
> 

| Durability Die | Item Type Examples |
| --- | --- |
| d4 | glass, ceramic, cloth |
| d6 | light or normal weapons, light armor, wood, leather |
| d8 | heavy or two-handed weapons, heavy armor, metal, stone |

**Increasing Durability**

The Durability dies listed above are representative of the mundane form of the items mentions. Items of higher Quality (e.g. magic items) increase their Durability die by a number of steps depending on the material it is made from or the potency of the magical enchantment. If the Durability die would ever increase above d12, it instead reduces the range of failing results. For example, for a d12+1 Durability die, you would roll a d12 and only fail the check on a 1-2. A Durability of d12+2 only fails on a 1 and d12+3 is considered indestructible (often paired with special conditions to destroy the item).

| Durability Die | Failure Range |
| --- | --- |
| d4–d12 | 1–3 |
| d12+1 | 1–2 |
| d12+2 | 1 |
| d12+3 | Indestructible (no check unless stated) |

## Equipment

Equipment are the types of items that you carry on your person. You can only ever wear one piece of equipment per slot (except rings) and benefit from their effects.

**Equipment Slots**

- Head (*helmet, headband, mask, …*)
- Neck (*amulet, brooch, scarf, …*)
- Back (*cape, cloak, mantle, …*)
- Body (*armor, robe, tunic, …*)
