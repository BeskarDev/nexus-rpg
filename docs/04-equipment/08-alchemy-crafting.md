# ðŸ§ª Alchemy & Potion Crafting

![banner-img](/img/banner/crafting-banner.png)

Alchemy is the art of combining natural and supernatural ingredients to create potions, poisons, salves, and other alchemical concoctions. Unlike enchantment, which manipulates magical forces directly, alchemy draws power from the inherent properties of materialsâ€”herbs, minerals, creature parts, and rare essences.

This system provides rules for crafting alchemical items through ingredient combination, experimentation, and careful preparation during downtime.

## Ingredient Taxonomy

All alchemical ingredients are categorized by **tags** and **potency tiers**. Tags determine what kind of effects an ingredient can produce, while potency determines the strength and Quality of the resulting creation.

### Ingredient Tags

Each ingredient has one or more tags that define its alchemical properties:

| Tag | Effect Category | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Essence** | Primary effect carrier; determines the potion's core function | Healing herbs, toxic mushrooms, energizing roots |
| **Catalyst** | Activates or amplifies the essence's power | Elemental salts, volatile spirits, crystalline powders |
| **Binder** | Stabilizes mixture and extends duration | Animal fat, tree resins, gelatinous extracts |
| **Stabilizer** | Improves reliability and reduces side effects | Purified water, mineral clay, ground bone |
| **Poison (Contact)** | Harmful on skin contact | Caustic oils, burning saps |
| **Poison (Ingested)** | Harmful when consumed | Toxic berries, tainted fungi |
| **Poison (Inhaled)** | Harmful when breathed | Spore clouds, noxious vapors |
| **Poison (Injury)** | Harmful through bloodstream | Venom glands, toxic extracts |
| **Reagent** | Modifies or enhances other properties | Moonstone dust, alchemical mercury |

### Potency Tiers

Ingredient potency determines the maximum Quality of alchemical items that can be created. Potency aligns with the existing Quality system:

| Potency Tier | Quality Range | Ingredient Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Primitive (Q1)** | Q1 | Common weeds, basic minerals, ash |
| **Common (Q2)** | Q1-Q2 | Medicinal herbs, iron filings, charcoal |
| **Exotic (Q3)** | Q1-Q3 | Rare flowers, alchemical silver, crushed gems |
| **Potent (Q4)** | Q1-Q4 | Monster glands, elemental essences, enchanted herbs |
| **Greater (Q5)** | Q1-Q5 | Dragon blood, celestial minerals, spirit flora |
| **Legendary (Q6+)** | Q1-Q7 | Phoenix ash, void crystals, divine ichor |

> **Note:** An ingredient's potency sets the **maximum** Quality achievable, but you can always create lower-Quality items with high-potency ingredients. The final item's Quality is determined by your Crafting skill, recipe complexity, and success level.

## Crafting Alchemical Items

Creating alchemical items follows the standard crafting rules (see **Craft an Item** downtime activity) with specific modifications for alchemy.

### Requirements

To craft alchemical items during downtime, you need:

1. **Alchemist profession** (learned through Crafting skill)
2. **Alchemist's Supplies** (50 coins, 1 load)
3. **Appropriate ingredients** (see Ingredient Compendium)
4. **Workstation** (access to a laboratory, workshop, or suitable crafting space)
5. **Recipe knowledge** (either known formulas or experimentation)

### Crafting Procedure

**Step 1: Choose or Experiment**

- **Known Recipe:** Use an established formula with predetermined ingredients and effects. Roll against standard Crafting Difficulty.
- **Experimentation:** Combine ingredients without a known recipe. Gain +1 bane on the crafting roll but may discover new formulas.

**Step 2: Gather Ingredients**

Select ingredients that match your desired effect:

- **Minimum ingredients:** 1 Essence + 1 Catalyst (for basic potions)
- **Standard recipe:** 1 Essence + 1 Catalyst + 1 Binder (for stable potions)
- **Advanced recipe:** 1 Essence + 1 Catalyst + 1 Binder + 1 Stabilizer (for refined items)
- **Poison recipes:** Any poison-tagged ingredient + appropriate delivery modifiers

The **highest potency tier** among your ingredients determines the maximum Quality achievable.

**Step 3: Pay Costs**

- **Material cost:** 1/2 the final item's value (as per standard crafting rules)
- **Weekly expenses:** Based on target Quality (10-25,000 coins/week)
- **Ingredient costs:** If purchasing ingredients rather than harvesting them

**Step 4: Roll Crafting Check**

Roll Mind + Crafting vs. the item's Crafting Difficulty:

| Item Quality | Crafting Difficulty | Required Successes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Easy (6) | 1 |
| 2 | Easy (6) | 2 |
| 3 | Medium (8) | 4 |
| 4 | Hard (10) | 6 |
| 5 | Very Hard (12) | 8 |
| 6 | Extreme (14) | 10 |
| 7 | Legendary (16) | 12 |

**Blunder.** Roll on the Alchemical Mishap table (see below). Check 0 successes.

**Failure.** Check 0 successes, or 1 success by doubling weekly expenses.

**Weak.** Check 1 success.

**Strong.** Check 2 successes.

**Critical.** Check 3 successes.

### Alchemical Mishap Table

When you blunder while crafting alchemical items, roll 1d6:

| d6 | Mishap |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **Toxic Fumes.** The mixture releases noxious vapors. You and anyone in melee range must succeed on a medium Spirit + Fortitude test or become poisoned for a short duration. All ingredients are lost. |
| 2 | **Unstable Reaction.** The concoction explodes, dealing 2d6 blast damage to you and destroying the workspace for 1d4 days. All ingredients are lost. |
| 3 | **Corrupted Batch.** You create a tainted version of the intended item. It appears normal but has unpredictable effects (GM's discretion). Check 1 success but the item is cursed. |
| 4 | **Ingredient Contamination.** Half your ingredients (rounded up) are ruined and must be replaced. Check 0 successes. |
| 5 | **Wasted Time.** The process takes twice as long. You must spend an additional week and pay weekly expenses again to complete the item. Check 0 successes. |
| 6 | **Alchemical Burn.** The mixture splashes on you, dealing 1d6 acid or fire damage (choose one). Make a hard Strength + Fortitude test or gain a temporary Wound that heals after a night's rest. All ingredients are lost. |

### Batch Crafting

When crafting alchemical consumables (potions, poisons, bombs), you can create multiple identical items simultaneously:

- **Same recipe, same ingredients:** Use the same material costs but multiply by the number of items.
- **Single crafting roll:** One roll determines success for the entire batch.
- **Successes apply to all items:** If you achieve enough successes to complete one item, you complete all items in the batch.
- **Maximum batch size:** Equal to your Crafting rank (minimum 1).

> **Example:** A Crafting rank 3 alchemist wants to create 3 healing potions (Q2). They pay for ingredients three times (90 coins total) and roll once. On a weak success (1 success), they fail to complete any potions because Q2 items require 2 successes. On a strong success (2 successes), all three potions are completed.

## Potion Properties

Potions and alchemical items have several standard properties:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Consumable** | The item is destroyed after use. |
| **Fragile** | The item gains the fragile property and breaks easily if dropped or hit. |
| **Uses (X)** | The item contains X uses before being depleted. |
| **Duration (X)** | Effects last for the specified duration (briefly, short, medium, long). |
| **Onset (X)** | Delay before effects take place (immediate, 1 round, 1 minute, etc.). |

### Potion Delivery Methods

How a potion is administered affects its properties:

| Method | Action Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Drink** | Action (or skip all Movement) | Standard consumption method |
| **Apply (salve/oil)** | Action | Applied to skin, wounds, or objects |
| **Coat weapon** | Quick Action | Applies poison or enhancement to weapon |
| **Throw (bomb/splash)** | Attack action | Thrown weapon with area effect |
| **Inhale (vapor)** | Quick Action | Breathed in from opened vial |

## The Poison System

Poisons are specialized alchemical items designed to harm, hinder, or debilitate. They follow unique rules for delivery, effects, and resistance.

### Poison Delivery Types

Every poison has one or more delivery methods:

#### Contact Poisons

Applied to surfaces or objects. Affects the first creature that touches the poisoned area.

- **Application:** Coat doorknobs, trap triggers, clothing, or other surfaces
- **Onset:** Immediate upon contact
- **Duration:** Poison remains potent for a medium duration on surfaces
- **Save:** Spirit + Fortitude vs. poison's TN

#### Ingested Poisons

Mixed into food or drink. Affects creatures that consume the poisoned substance.

- **Application:** Mix into meals, water, wine, or other consumables
- **Onset:** 1-10 minutes after ingestion (roll 1d10)
- **Duration:** Varies by poison type
- **Save:** Strength + Fortitude vs. poison's TN
- **Detection:** Hard Mind + Perception or Nature test to detect unusual taste/smell

#### Inhaled Poisons

Released as gas, powder, or vapor. Affects all creatures in an area.

- **Application:** Release in enclosed space or throw as grenade
- **Area:** Close range burst from release point
- **Onset:** Immediate upon inhalation
- **Duration:** Gas disperses after short duration
- **Save:** Spirit + Fortitude vs. poison's TN
- **Holding breath:** Creatures holding breath gain +1 boon on save

#### Injury Poisons

Applied to weapons or delivered through wounds.

- **Application:** Coat one weapon, ammo bundle, or trap mechanism
- **Onset:** Immediate when weapon hits and deals damage
- **Duration:** Coating lasts short duration or until weapon hits
- **Save:** Strength + Fortitude vs. poison's TN
- **Application action:** Quick Action to coat weapon

### Poison Save DC

The Target Number (TN) for resisting a poison's effects is determined by its Quality:

| Poison Quality | Save TN | Potency Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Q1 | TN 6 | Weak |
| Q2 | TN 8 | Simple |
| Q3 | TN 10 | Decent |
| Q4 | TN 12 | Strong |
| Q5 | TN 14 | Potent |
| Q6 | TN 16 | Deadly |
| Q7 | TN 18 | Legendary |

### Poison Effects

Poisons can inflict various conditions and damage types:

**Damage Types:**
- Poison damage (ignores AV)
- Acid damage (burning, corrosive)
- Necrotic damage (tissue death, decay)

**Common Conditions:**
- **poisoned** (general sickness, +1 bane on all rolls)
- **staggered** (limited actions)
- **stunned** (severe incapacitation)
- **paralyzed** (complete immobilization)
- **unconscious** (complete shutdown)
- **blinded** (ocular damage)
- **confused** (mental disruption)

**Duration by Quality:**

| Quality | Typical Duration |
| --- | --- |
| Q1-Q2 | Briefly (end of next turn) |
| Q3-Q4 | Short (until short break) |
| Q5-Q6 | Medium (one hour) |
| Q7 | Long (until night's rest) or permanent |

### Ending Poison Effects Early

Creatures affected by poison can attempt to end the effect:

- **Natural recovery:** Roll save again at end of each turn (or as specified)
- **Medical aid:** Another creature can use Action + Spirit/Mind + Nature vs. poison TN to treat
- **Antitoxin:** Drinking antitoxin grants automatic success on next save
- **Magical healing:** Some spells specifically cure poison conditions
- **Rest:** Short break removes briefly-duration poisons, night's rest removes short-duration

### Poison Resistance and Immunity

Some creatures have resistance or immunity to poisons:

- **Resistance:** Successful save ends effect immediately; damage reduced by half
- **Immunity:** Completely unaffected by poison
- **Successive immunity:** After succeeding against a specific poison once, gain +1 boon on saves vs. that poison for the rest of the scene

### Stacking and Overdose

- **Same poison, same target:** Effects don't stack; only highest potency applies
- **Different poisons, same target:** Effects stack, but each poison tracks separately
- **Overdose (GM option):** Taking 3+ different poisons simultaneously may cause additional complications

### Antidotes and Neutralization

**Antitoxin (General)**
- **Cost:** 30 coins (Q2)
- **Effect:** Grants automatic success on next save vs. one poison
- **Limitation:** Must be used within 1 minute of poisoning

**Specific Antidotes**
- Crafted to counter specific poison types
- **Cost:** Equal to poison being countered
- **Effect:** Automatically ends poison effect from specific source
- **Crafting:** Requires sample of original poison + Alchemist profession

**Universal Panacea (Q5+)**
- Legendary alchemical item
- Cures all poison effects simultaneously
- Extremely rare and expensive

## GM Guidance

### Ingredient Availability

Adjust ingredient availability based on setting and story:

- **Abundant regions:** Forests, swamps, and jungles have plentiful Q1-Q2 ingredients
- **Rare sources:** Elemental planes, magical groves have Q4+ ingredients
- **Seasonal variation:** Some ingredients only available certain times of year
- **Political factors:** Wars, blights, or trade restrictions affect access

### Balancing Alchemy

- **Limit stockpiling:** Potions take inventory space (1 load each or 4 in potion satchel)
- **Degradation (optional):** Potions lose potency after weeks/months
- **Market saturation:** Flooding market with potions reduces sale prices
- **Moral consequences:** Using poisons may affect reputation and legal standing

### Treasure as Ingredients

When assigning treasure, consider offering ingredients instead of coins:

- Harvested monster parts
- Rare botanical specimens
- Ancient alchemical formulae
- Exotic mineral deposits

This provides alchemists with direct crafting materials while maintaining treasure balance.
