# ðŸ§ª Alchemy & Potion Crafting

![banner-img](/img/banner/crafting-banner.png)

Combine ingredients to craft potions, poisons, and alchemical items. Each ingredient has **tags** (effect type) and **potency** (max Quality).

## Ingredients

### Tags

| Tag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **Essence (type)** | Core effect: healing, toxic, fire, sleep, strength, etc. |
| **Catalyst** | Amplifies power |
| **Binder** | Extends duration |
| **Poison (type)** | Contact, Ingested, Inhaled, or Injury delivery |

### Potency

Ingredient potency = maximum item Quality.

| Potency | Sources |
| --- | --- |
| Q1-Q2 | Common herbs, minerals, animal parts |
| Q3-Q4 | Rare plants, monster parts, elemental essences |
| Q5-Q7 | Dragon blood, phoenix ash, divine materials |

## Crafting

Use standard **Craft an Item** downtime rules (see Downtime section) with these specifics:

**Requirements:**
- Alchemist profession
- Alchemist's Supplies (50 coins, 1 load)
- Ingredients totaling 1/2 item cost

**Recipe:**
- **Basic:** 1 Essence + 1 Catalyst
- **Standard:** Add 1 Binder for longer duration
- **Advanced:** Add more ingredients for special effects

**Process:**
1. Choose known recipe or experiment (+1 bane on roll)
2. Pay ingredient costs
3. Roll Mind + Crafting vs. Quality TN (standard crafting table)
4. Track successes until item complete

**Batch Crafting:** Create up to your Crafting rank identical items with one roll. Pay material cost for each.

### Mishaps (on Blunder)

| d6 | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Toxic fumes - all nearby make Spirit + Fortitude vs. TN 8 or poisoned (short) |
| 2 | Explosion - 2d6 blast damage, workspace damaged (1d4 days) |
| 3 | Cursed batch - appears normal, unpredictable effects (GM choice) |
| 4 | Half ingredients ruined |
| 5 | Double time required |
| 6 | Alchemical burn - 1d6 acid/fire damage, hard STR + Fortitude or Wound |

## Poisons

### Delivery Types

| Type | Apply | Save | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Contact** | Coat surface (Action) | Spirit + Fortitude | Immediate, lasts medium on surface |
| **Ingested** | Mix in food/drink | Strength + Fortitude | 1d10 minute onset |
| **Inhaled** | Gas/powder, close area | Spirit + Fortitude | Immediate, +1 boon if holding breath |
| **Injury** | Coat weapon (Quick Action) | Strength + Fortitude | Immediate on hit, lasts short on weapon |

### Effects by Quality

| Quality | Save TN | Typical Effect | Duration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Q1-Q2 | 6-8 | +2-4 poison damage or **poisoned** | Briefly |
| Q3-Q4 | 10-12 | +4-6 damage or **poisoned** + **staggered** | Short |
| Q5-Q6 | 14-16 | +6-8 damage or **stunned**/**paralyzed** | Medium |
| Q7 | 18 | +8+ damage or **unconscious** | Long |

**Ending Early:** Target saves at turn end. Ally can use Action + Spirit/Mind + Nature vs. TN to treat.

**Antitoxin:** Drink as Action to gain automatic success on next poison save (Q2, 30 coins).

**Stacking:** Same poison doesn't stack. Different poisons track separately.

## Gathering Ingredients

Use as downtime activity (1 week):

Roll Mind/Spirit + Nature or Agility/Spirit + Survival vs. difficulty:

| Ingredient Potency | Difficulty | Yield |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Q1 | Trivial (4) | 1d6 ingredients |
| Q2 | Easy (6) | 1d4 ingredients |
| Q3 | Medium (8) | 1d3 ingredients |
| Q4 | Hard (10) | 1d2 ingredients |
| Q5+ | Very Hard (12+) | 1 ingredient |

**Blunder:** No yield. Roll complication (d6):
1. Poisoned contact (TN 10 or poisoned short)
2. Hostile creature encounter
3. Storm delays return (1d3 days)
4. Lost, spend 1d6 coins on supplies
5. Tools damaged (-1 use)
6. Rival claims territory

**Harvesting Creatures:** Use Harvesting Creature Parts rules. Tool harvest = alchemical ingredients matching creature tier.
