# ðŸ§ª Alchemy & Potion Crafting

![banner-img](/img/banner/crafting-banner.png)

Craft potions, poisons, and alchemical items by combining ingredients. Use this system to create items from the Equipment list or design custom effects.

## Ingredients

Each ingredient has a **tag** (effect type) and **potency** (Quality tier).

**Tags:**
- **Essence (type):** Core effect - healing, toxic, fire, frost, lightning, sleep, strength, flight, invisibility, etc.
- **Catalyst:** Amplifies or activates the essence
- **Binder:** Extends duration or stabilizes the mixture

**Potency = Quality Tier:**

| Quality | Ingredient Cost | Example Sources |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Q1** | 1-5 coins | Common herbs, ash, basic minerals |
| **Q2** | 5-25 coins | Medicinal plants, copper dust, charcoal, animal parts |
| **Q3** | 40-100 coins | Rare flowers, monster blood, elemental salts |
| **Q4** | 200-400 coins | Dragon bile, troll blood, giant organs |
| **Q5** | 800-1,500 coins | Phoenix ash, unicorn horn, celestial minerals |
| **Q6** | 4,000-8,000 coins | Elder dragon parts, divine ichor |
| **Q7** | 15,000+ coins | Legendary materials, cosmic essences |

**Acquisition:**
- **Gathering:** Downtime activity (see below) to harvest from wilderness
- **Creature Harvesting:** Tool harvest from defeated creatures = alchemical ingredients
- **Purchase:** Available at settlements up to their rank (Hamlet Q1, Village Q2, Town Q3, City Q4)
- **Quest Rewards:** Q5+ materials rarely sold, must be quested for

## Crafting

Use standard **Craft an Item** downtime rules with these specifics:

**Requirements:**
- Alchemist profession
- Alchemist's Supplies (50 coins, 1 load)
- Ingredients totaling 1/2 final item cost

**Basic Recipe:** 1 Essence + 1 Catalyst (minimum)  
**Extended Duration:** Add 1 Binder  
**Special Effects:** Add more ingredients as needed

**Process:**
1. Design effect and choose Quality tier
2. Select ingredients matching desired effect
3. Pay ingredient costs (total = 1/2 item value)
4. Roll Mind + Crafting vs. Quality TN (see Downtime: Craft an Item)
5. Track successes until complete

**Experimentation:** Use unknown ingredient combinations with +1 bane on crafting roll.

**Batch Crafting:** Create up to Crafting rank identical items with one roll. Pay full material cost for each.

### Mishaps (on Blunder)

| d6 | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Toxic fumes - all nearby save Spirit + Fortitude TN 8 or **poisoned** (short) |
| 2 | Explosion - 2d6 blast damage, workspace unusable 1d4 days |
| 3 | Cursed result - appears normal, unpredictable effects |
| 4 | Half ingredients destroyed |
| 5 | Takes double time and cost |
| 6 | Alchemical burn - 1d6 acid/fire damage, save STR + Fort (hard) or Wound |

Alchemical items can produce various effects. Use these categories as guidelines:

### Equipment List Items
