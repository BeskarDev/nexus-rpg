## Quick Start

**Want to jump right in?** Follow these steps:

1. **Choose a magic school** (Arcane Discipline or Mystic Tradition)
2. **Pick 1-3 thematic aspects** from that school's list
3. **Select an effect type** (damage, buff, debuff, summon, zone, or utility)
4. **Choose delivery method** (single-target, area effect, enchantment, etc.)
5. **Set the rank** (0-5, with 5 being peak mortal power)
6. **Use the template formula** to calculate numbers
7. **Write it up** with evocative flavor
8. **Validate** against the checklist

**Example in 30 seconds:**
- School: Evocation (arcane)
- Aspects: fire, blast
- Effect: Damage

## Understanding the Framework

### What Are Aspects?

**Aspects** are thematic keywords that define what a spell can do. Each magic school (Arcane Discipline or Mystic Tradition) has a list of aspects that represent its identity.

**Example - Evocation Aspects**:
- Primary: *fire, frost, lightning, acid, blast*
- Secondary: *elemental-barrier, burning, chilling, shocking, corroding, concussive*
- Tertiary: *ward, immunity, absorption*

When you choose aspects for your spell, you're defining:
- **What the spell feels like** (fire = heat and light, frost = cold and ice)
- **What mechanics are appropriate** (fire → burning condition, frost → slowed)
- **What tradition it belongs to** (only use aspects from one school)

### The Six Effect Templates

Every spell in Nexus RPG falls into one of six categories:

1. **Direct Damage** - Hurts enemies directly
   - Examples: Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Ice Shards
   
2. **Buff/Enchantment** - Makes allies stronger
   - Examples: Bless Weapon, Shield of Faith, Haste
   
3. **Debuff/Condition** - Makes enemies weaker
   - Examples: Curse, Slow, Fear
   
4. **Summoning/Creation** - Brings creatures or objects into being
   - Examples: Summon Elemental, Create Wall, Conjure Object
   
5. **Zone/Area Control** - Creates lasting environmental effects
   - Examples: Wall of Fire, Fog Cloud, Spike Growth
   
6. **Utility/Exploration** - Non-combat functionality
   - Examples: Detect Magic, Speak with Animals, Teleport

### Bounded Power Ceiling

**Critical Rule**: Rank 5 is the absolute peak of mortal magic in Nexus RPG.

This is roughly equivalent to D&D 7th level spells, NOT 9th level. Your most powerful custom spells should be impressive but not reality-warping.

**Acceptable at Rank 5**:
- ✅ Massive damage (but enemies can survive it)
- ✅ Summoning powerful creatures (Tier 4-5)
- ✅ Large-scale battlefield control
- ✅ Powerful buffs/debuffs
- ✅ Extraordinary utility (teleportation, scrying)

**NOT Acceptable at Rank 5**:
- ❌ Instant death effects with no save
- ❌ Reality alteration (Wish, Time Stop)
- ❌ True resurrection
- ❌ Permanent transformations without drawbacks
- ❌ Unbreakable concentration or immunity to all conditions

## Step-by-Step Creation

### Step 1: Choose Your Magic School

First, decide whether this is an **Arcane** or **Mystic** spell, then pick the specific school.

#### Arcane Disciplines (Mind-based, transgressive)

| Discipline | Identity | Best For |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **Evocation** | Elemental offense | Raw damage, elemental effects |
| **Illusion** | Sensory deception | Stealth, trickery, confusion |
| **Conjuration** | Forced summoning | Summons, teleportation, creation |
| **Telepathy** | Mind control | Mental manipulation, charm |
| **Telekinetics** | Force manipulation | Movement, barriers, crushing |
| **Necromancy** | Death magic | Life drain, undead, decay |

#### Mystic Traditions (Spirit-based, reverent)

| Tradition | Identity | Best For |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Light** | Truth and purification | Anti-undead, revelation, radiant damage |
| **Twilight** | Dreams and mystery | Sleep, divination, shadows |
| **Life** | Growth and healing | Healing, blessings, restoration |
| **Death** | Natural endings | Curses, fear, ancestral communion |
| **Nature** | Wilderness harmony | Animals, plants, weather |
| **Tempest** | Destructive forces | Storms, lightning, earthquakes |
| **Peace** | Protection and calm | Sanctuary, wards, safe travel |
| **War** | Honorable combat | Weapon blessings, battle fury |

**Tip**: Choose based on the spell's theme and your NPC/setting needs, not just mechanics.

### Step 2: Select 1-3 Aspects

Once you've chosen a school, look at its aspect list and select 1-3 aspects that fit your spell concept.

### Step 3: Choose Effect Template and Apply Formula

Select which of the six templates your spell uses, then apply the appropriate formula.

#### Template 1: Direct Damage

**When to use**: Spell primarily deals damage to enemies.

**Formula**:
```
Single-Target Damage:
Rank 0: +2/+4/+6 (Weak/Strong/Critical)
Rank 1: +4/+8/+12
Rank 2: +6/+12/+18
Rank 3: +8/+16/+24
Rank 4: +10/+20/+30
Rank 5: +12/+24/+36

AoE Damage (reduce by one rank):
Rank 1 AoE: +2/+4/+6
Rank 2 AoE: +4/+8/+12
Rank 3 AoE: +6/+12/+18
Rank 4 AoE: +8/+16/+24
Rank 5 AoE: +10/+20/+30
```

**Damage Types** (match to aspects):
- Fire → burning (2/4/6 damage per turn)
- Frost → slowed/dazed
- Lightning → staggered/stunned
- Acid → corroding (ignore half AV)
- Poison → poisoned condition
- Necrotic → life-drained/weakened
- Psychic → frightened/confused
- Radiant → blinded
- Physical → prone/knocked back

**Example**:

```

#### Template 3: Debuff/Condition

```

#### Template 6: Utility/Exploration

**When to use**: Spell provides non-combat benefits (information, communication, transportation, etc.).

**Formula**:
```
Power Level:
Rank 0-1: Local, simple effects (speak with animals, detect magic)
Rank 2-3: Significant effects (telepathy, short-range teleport, scrying)
Rank 4-5: Extraordinary effects (plane shift, long-range teleport, major divination)

No strict formula - design based on usefulness and rank appropriateness
```

**Example**:
```markdown
### Commune with Ancestors (*death*, Rank 3)
**Properties:** ritual (hours)

**Effect**
You perform a sacred rite to contact the spirits of the dead, seeking wisdom from those who came before.
**Weak.** You can ask one question of a specific deceased individual. They answer truthfully but briefly (one sentence).
**Strong.** You can ask three questions and receive more detailed answers. The spirit can also share one vision of a significant memory.
**Critical.** You can ask five questions, receive detailed answers, and the spirit can guide you toward a solution to a problem you describe. You also learn one secret the spirit held in life.

The ritual requires a personal item from the deceased or a connection to their bloodline.
```

### Step 4: Choose Delivery Method

Decide how the spell effect reaches its targets.

**Single-Target**: No property needed, standard range (Medium is most common)

**Area Effects** (use `blast` property):
- `blast (cone)` - Conical area extending from you
- `blast (line)` - Line effect hitting all in path
- `blast (burst)` - Explodes at a point, affects area around it
- `blast (wall)` - Creates a barrier between two points
- `blast (aura)` - Centered on caster, moves with you
- `blast (chain)` - Bounces between targets (up to Rank+1 targets)

**Enchantments**: Use `enchant (target)` property
- `enchant (weapon)` - Enhances a weapon
- `enchant (armor)` - Enhances armor
- `enchant (body)` - Enhances the creature itself
- `enchant (eyes)` - Enhances vision
- Add `singular` if only one instance can be active

**Special Modifiers**:
- `concentrate` - Requires concentration (breaks on damage/action)
- `quick` - Can be cast as Quick Action
- `ritual (X)` - Takes minutes/hours/days to cast
- `persistent` - Effect remains after casting
- `illusory` - Can be disbelieved with Spirit + Perception check

### Step 5: Set the Rank

Choose rank 0-5 based on desired power level:

| Rank | Power Level | Focus Cost | Common For |
|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| 0 | Cantrip (unlimited use) | 0 | Minor damage, simple utility |
| 1 | Basic spell | 2 | Entry-level combat/utility |
| 2 | Moderate power | 4 | Mid-level adventurers |
| 3 | Significant power | 6 | Experienced casters |
| 4 | Very powerful | 8 | Master casters |
| 5 | Peak mortal magic | 10 | Legendary casters |

**Guidelines**:
- Rank 0: Can be used repeatedly without rest
- Rank 1-2: Common adventuring spells
- Rank 3-4: Signature powerful spells
- Rank 5: Once-per-day game-changers

### Step 6: Write the Spell

Use this format:

```markdown
### Spell Name (*tradition/discipline*, Rank X)
**Properties:** [list all properties, or "-" for none]

**Effect**
[2-3 sentences of evocative flavor description incorporating your aspects]
**Weak.** [Mechanical effect for weak success (0-2 above TN)]
**Strong.** [Mechanical effect for strong success (3-5 above TN)]
**Critical.** [Mechanical effect for critical success (6+ above TN)]

[Optional: Additional utility uses or special interactions]

**Heighten.** [Optional: If spell scales well to higher ranks]
```

**Tips for good descriptions**:
- Use sensory details (what does it look, sound, feel like?)
- Incorporate aspects into the flavor ("crackling lightning", "writhing shadows")
- Keep mechanics clear and specific (exact damage, durations, TNs)
- Make success levels scale meaningfully (not just +damage)

### Step 7: Validate Your Spell

Use this checklist:

- [ ] **Aspects**: Uses 1-3 aspects, all from the same school
- [ ] **Template**: Follows one of the six templates
- [ ] **Numbers**: Damage/bonuses match rank guidelines
- [ ] **Delivery**: Has clear targeting and range
- [ ] **Properties**: Uses properties correctly
- [ ] **Duration**: Specifies how long effects last
- [ ] **Bounded Power**: Rank 5 or below, not reality-warping
- [ ] **Clarity**: All mechanical effects are unambiguous
- [ ] **Balance**: Not strictly better than existing spells
- [ ] **Theme**: Feels appropriate for the tradition/discipline

**Step 1 - Choose School**: Evocation (arcane) - fits fire theme

**Step 2 - Select Aspects**: *fire, burning* (2 aspects)

**Step 3 - Choose Template**: Direct Damage

**Step 4 - Delivery Method**: `blast (cone)` for dramatic area effect

**Step 5 - Set Rank**: Rank 3 (significant power, good for boss fight)

**Strong.** You can hold a two-way dream conversation with one creature you've met, regardless of distance (must be same plane). Conversation lasts up to one hour.
**Critical.** As strong, but you can include up to three additional participants in the dream conference, and you can share visual memories and emotions in addition to speech.

This spell cannot be intercepted or eavesdropped upon except by those who are invited to participate.
```

**Step 8 - Validate**:
- ✅ Uses 3 Twilight aspects (complex spell)
- ✅ Utility appropriate for Rank 2

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "My spell feels too weak for its rank"

**Diagnosis**: Likely using conservative numbers or not enough secondary effects.

**Solutions**:
- Verify damage matches the rank formula exactly
- Add conditions or secondary effects on strong/critical
- Check that AoE spells use appropriate area size
- Consider adding utility riders (light emission, environmental effects)

**Example**: Rank 3 fire spell dealing only +4/8/12 damage.
- ❌ Wrong: Uses Rank 1 values
- ✅ Fixed: Should be +8/16/24 for single-target OR +6/12/18 for AoE

#### "My spell feels too strong for its rank"

**Diagnosis**: Combining too many powerful effects or exceeding damage formulas.

**Solutions**:
- Remove one secondary effect
- Reduce damage if combining with strong condition
- Shorten duration
- Add concentration requirement
- Increase rank

**Example**: Rank 2 spell dealing +8/16/24 damage AND stunning on hit.
- ❌ Wrong: Uses Rank 3 damage + severe condition
- ✅ Fixed: Either use +6/12/18 damage with stun, or +8/16/24 with minor slow

#### "My aspects don't fit any discipline/tradition"

**Diagnosis**: Trying to create a spell that crosses school boundaries.

**Solutions**:
- Choose the school that best fits the PRIMARY effect
- Check secondary/tertiary aspect lists for your chosen school
- Consider if this should be two separate spells
- Ask: "Could this reasonably come from one magical philosophy?"

**Example**: "Fire and shadow tentacles spell"
- ❌ Wrong: Mixing Evocation (fire) with Necromancy (tentacles)
- ✅ Fixed Option 1: Pure Evocation fire tentacles (use *fire, binding* aspects from Evocation's extended list)
- ✅ Fixed Option 2: Pure Necromancy shadow tentacles (use *grasping shadows* concept)

#### "I can't find aspects for my concept"

**Diagnosis**: Either concept doesn't fit Nexus magic, or you're looking in the wrong school.

**Solutions**:
- Review all 14 schools to find the best fit
- Use tertiary aspects (more specific/creative)
- Combine 2-3 aspects creatively
- Consider if this needs to be a talent ability instead of a spell

**Example**: "Time manipulation spell"
- ❌ Not directly supported: No "time" aspects exist (bounded power philosophy)
- ✅ Alternative 1: Twilight *fate, prophecy* for limited time sight
- ✅ Alternative 2: Create "slow time" effect using Twilight *sleep, dreams* (everyone else slows down from perspective)

#### "My spell targets are unclear"

**Diagnosis**: Ambiguous targeting language or conflicting properties.

**Solutions**:
- Specify exact number of targets OR area size
- Use "vs. Dodge", "vs. Resist", or "vs. Parry" for hostile effects
- For buffs, use "Touch" or "Self" clearly
- Add "willing creatures only" if appropriate

**Example**: "Affects nearby enemies"
- ❌ Ambiguous: How many? What range?
- ✅ Fixed: "All creatures in close area vs. Dodge"

#### "Duration seems wrong"

**Diagnosis**: Not matching duration to spell power and rank.

**Solutions**:
- Weak success: Briefly to Short
- Strong success: Short to Medium
- Critical success: Medium to Long
- Powerful effects (conditions, high bonuses) should have shorter durations
- Utility effects can have longer durations

**Example**: Rank 5 domination lasting "permanently"
- ❌ Too strong: No save, no end
- ✅ Fixed: "Medium duration while concentrating, target can save at end of each turn"

## Converting from Other Systems

### From D&D 5e

**Step 1**: Identify equivalent spell level
- D&D Cantrips → Rank 0
- D&D 1st-2nd level → Rank 1-2
- D&D 3rd-4th level → Rank 2-3
- D&D 5th-6th level → Rank 3-4
- D&D 7th level → Rank 5
- D&D 8th-9th level → **Cannot be directly converted** (exceeds Nexus power ceiling)

**Step 2**: Match to Nexus tradition/discipline
- Evocation school → Evocation discipline (usually)
- Necromancy school → Necromancy discipline or Death tradition
- Divination school → Twilight or Light tradition
- Abjuration school → Peace tradition or protective aspects
- Conjuration school → Conjuration discipline
- Enchantment school → Telepathy discipline
- Illusion school → Illusion discipline
- Transmutation school → Telekinetics or Nature

**Step 3**: Convert damage
- Use Nexus damage formula for chosen rank
- Success levels replace upcasting

**Step 4**: Adjust duration
- Concentration → `concentrate` property
- 1 minute → Short
- 10 minutes → Medium
- 1 hour → Medium
- 8 hours → Long
- 24 hours → Long

**Example - Converting Fireball**:
- D&D: 3rd level, 8d6 damage (avg 28), Dex save half, 20 ft radius
- Nexus: Rank 3, +6/12/18 damage, vs. Dodge, close area burst
- Result: Close but balanced to Nexus power curve

```markdown
### Fireball (*evocation*, Rank 3)
**Properties:** blast (burst)

**Effect**
You create a bead of fire that streaks to a point you choose and explodes in a roaring blast.
**Weak.** Deal +6 fire damage to all creatures in close area.
**Strong.** Deal +12 fire damage to all creatures in close area.
**Critical.** Deal +18 fire damage to all creatures in close area, and each target suffers burning (4) for short duration.
```

### From Pathfinder

Similar process to D&D 5e, but be extra cautious:
- Pathfinder power scales higher than Nexus
- Many Pathfinder spells have too many effects for one Nexus spell
- Focus on the PRIMARY effect, drop minor riders
- Bounded power ceiling means some Pathfinder spells simply can't convert

### From Other d20 Systems

General guidelines:
1. Identify the spell's primary function (damage, buff, control, etc.)
2. Match to a Nexus effect template
3. Use Nexus damage/bonus formulas, not the source system's
4. Add appropriate aspects for flavor
5. Test against power level calculator

## Final Tips

### Do's:
✅ Start simple - master the templates before getting creative  
✅ Test your spell in actual play  
✅ Ask "what would make this fun to use?"  
✅ Make success levels feel meaningfully different  
✅ Include flavor text that inspires roleplaying  
✅ Check existing spells for similar effects  

### Don'ts:
❌ Don't mix aspects from different schools  
❌ Don't exceed the Rank 5 power ceiling  
❌ Don't create "strictly better" versions of existing spells  
❌ Don't make effects that are too ambiguous  
❌ Don't forget concentration requirements on persistent effects  
❌ Don't allow permanent benefits without major costs
