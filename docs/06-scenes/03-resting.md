# 🏕️ Resting

There are different time frames for resting.

## A short break

This condition is met after one delving turn, during which you had a few moments to breathe and calm down. Being in an imminently dangerous place might hinder you from taking a short break until you find a safe or hidden place.

Benefits of a short break include:

- regain all of your HP
- regain all “once per combat” Abilities
- short-lasting effects end

## A night’s rest

After setting up camp, having a decent meal, and having a full night's sleep, you gain the following benefits:

- regain up to 1 Resolve
- regain all of your Focus
- regain 1/day Abilities
- lose two Fatigue
- roll a hard Strength + Fortitude test to heal one previously treated Injury
- long-lasting effects end

A night’s rest needs to last at least 8 hours, from which 2 hours can be used for light non-physical activity.

## A bad night

This option is met when you weren’t able to establish a proper camp for a night’s rest. This can happen, because you are out of food, the navigator couldn’t find good shelter during bad weather, or heavy interruption of your sleep. Instead of the benefits of a night’s rest, you:

- regain 1/2 your max. Focus
- regain 1/day Abilities
- lose one Fatigue
- long-lasting effects end
