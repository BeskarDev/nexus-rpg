# 🏠 Downtime

![banner-img](/img/banner/crafting-banner.png)

Whenever adventurers return from their perilous quests, they find solace in the familiar comforts of civilization. This downtime offers a chance to rest, replenish your supplies, and let you prepare for the challenges that lie ahead. You might spend your hard-earned coins on new equipment, forge alliances, or simply enjoy the peace and quiet of a well-deserved break.

Downtime is measured in weeks, where each adventurer can choose to partake in a variety of downtime activities. You choose one downtime activity per week.

When you take at least a week of downtime, it is assumed that you have time and opportunity to do the following things:

- You are able to spend any XP you gained during the last adventure on your skills. Think of a plausible way of how you utilize your skills you want to improve during downtime.
- You can buy and sell any items with a Quality equal or lower than the settlement’s advancement level. If you want to look for higher quality items, you can do so by taking the Haggle activity.
- You automatically heal one Wound per week of downtime. If you want to heal your Wounds faster, you can take the Recover activity.

## Settlements

Each type of civilized settlement falls into one of the following categories, where it‘s Settlement Rank denotes what Quality of items and infrastructure one can expect to find there (though there may be exceptions):

1. **Hamlet** (small primitive settlement or outpost with a handful of farms around it, consists of a few dozen inhabitants)
2. **Village** (decently sized settlement specialized in trade, farming, or other resources, consists of around one to two hundred inhabitants)
3. **Town** (the core settlement of a local region dependent on the produce of multiple villages to sustain itself, home of a local ruler overseeing multiple smaller settlements, consists of some hundreds of inhabitants)
4. **City** (the dominant settlement of entire realms dependent on the produce of multiple regions to sustain itself, residence of kings and queens, consists of some thousands of inhabitants)

> Note that there will always be exceptions to these Settlement Ranks. For example, a small outpost in the borderlands being frequently passed by shrewd merchants collecting rare artifacts will have a higher Settlement Rank for obtaining and selling magical items.
Anything with a Quality above 4 will also only be available in unique settlements outside of mortal realms. You might for instance have to find a village of forest spirits on the border of the mortal realm and those beyond to find high Quality enchanted items.

### Research

| Min. Settlement Rank | Requirements | Expenses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 (Town) | Education, Lore, Nature, or Streetwise skill depending on topic | 100 coins/week |

Research about a topic to learn facts or rumors. Choose one of the following expert skills, depending on the kind of topic you want to research about:

- **Education** (e.g. investigate the lineage of a noble family, uncover details about a historical battle, or research the architectural techniques of an ancient civilization)
- **Lore** (e.g. explore the mythology behind a legendary artifact, study the origins of a mysterious cult, or uncover forbidden magical knowledge from ancient texts)
- **Nature** (e.g. identify the medicinal properties of rare plants, study the migration patterns of an exotic animal species, or investigate the unique ecosystem of a remote wilderness region)
- **Streetwise** (e.g. gather rumors about underground criminal networks, learn about secret smuggling routes, or uncover the latest street-level gossip about local influential figures)

Discuss with your GM what kind of information you want to research about and they will set the Difficulty of that topic.

> Keep in mind that the GM has the last word in determining the Difficulty of the research test or if it is simply impossible to gain any information about a topic. For example, you won’t be able to find any information on a mythical figure which has been erased from historical records in a small town.
> 

After determining the research difficulty, roll Mind + your chosen Expert Skill vs. that Difficulty.

**Blunder.** You don’t learn anything new about the topic.  Also roll on the Complication table.

**Weak.** You learn vague or general information about the topic you research.

**Strong.** You learn concrete and reliable information about the topic you research.

**Critical.** You learn high-quality information about the topic you research. When utilizing the information you learned during your next adventure, you or one of your allies can choose to gain +1 boon on the roll.

### Haggle

| Min. Settlement Rank | Requirements | Expenses |
| --- | --- | --- |

Attempt to sell rare items up 3 + the Settlement Rank in Quality. Determine up to one item per week you take this downtime activity, where you spend the following amount of coins in the search and deal-making with the potential buyer depending on the item‘s Quality:

| Quality | Difficulty | Expenses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | TN 8 | 50 coins/week |
| 4 | TN 10 | 100 coins/week |
| 5 | TN 12 | 250 coins/week |

**Failure.** The buyer offers 40 percent of the normal cost of the item.

**Weak Success.** The buyer offers 50 percent of the normal cost of the item.

**Strong Success.** The buyer offers 60 percent of the normal cost of the item.

**Critical Success.** The buyer offers 70 percent of the normal cost of the item.

> Refusing to close the deal, for example after blundering the negotiation, will very likely anger the buyer and impose +1 bane to all further attempts to sell the same item (this penalty will apply each time additionally when refusing a deal multiple times). This represents the buyer spreading the news about your bad deal within their sphere of influence.
> 

### Recover

| Min. Settlement Rank | Requirements | Expenses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (Hamlet) | a healer, temple, or other medical facility | 50 coins/week |

After one week of recovering, you heal all your Wounds and other non-magical illnesses. To remove a magical sickness or curse, you must find a specialist, which potentially requires a more advanced settlement and more expenses:

| Magic Rank | Min. Settlement Rank | Expenses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2 | 250 coins/week |
| 2 | 2 | 1.000 coins/week |
| 3 | 3 | 2.000 coins/week |
| 4 | 4 | 10.000 coins/week |
| 5 | * | 50.000 coins/week |

* These curses or other magical effects exceed mortal capabilities with very few exceptions. You must find a legendary healer or a powerful spiritual being to heal your affliction. Note, that the indicated cost will probably transcend being paid in coin and will require some other form of favor.

### Provide Offering

| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (Hamlet) | Lore or Mysticism skill, temple or other holy place to your deity | 100 coins/week |

On a success, at the start of the next adventure, you and your allies gain +1 Resolve each (max. 3). Each one of you can only gain the benefit from this activity once per downtime scene.

On a failure, you gain +1 boon on the next roll for this activity once per downtime scene. This bonus stacks each time you fail the roll (+1 boon on the first failure, +2 on the second consecutive failure, and so on).

### Craft an Item

| Min. Settlement Rank | Requirements | Expenses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 (Village) | Crafting skill, appropriate tools and workstation | varies |

You can create items for your crafting professions up to a level of Quality determined by your Crafting skill (see the table below). This requires tools, a workstation, materials, and time. During the crafting process, any item requires an amount of successes depending on it‘s Quality.

| Item Quality | Required Crafting Rank | Required Successes | Crafting Difficulty |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | easy (6) |
| 2 | 0 | 2 | easy (6) |
| 3 | 1 | 4 | medium (8) |
| 4 | 2 | 6 | hard (10) |
| 5 | 3 | 8 | very hard (12) |
| 6 | 4 | 10 | extreme (14) |
| 7 | 5 | 12 | legendary (16) |

**#### Resolving Crafting Rolls**

When you choose to craft an item during downtime, first determine the required crafting profession for that type of item (e.g. smithing for a sword, woodworking for a bow, and so on).

You can only craft items for which you have the required Crafting rank and profession. You also have to have the right tools, materials, and pay your weekly expenses during the crafting process.

**Tools**

Most mundane tools will cost you 50 coins and can be found in any decently sized settlement.

**Materials**

You must spend 1/2 of the item‘s cost for it‘s raw materials. At higher Quality tiers, this includes the cost for enchantments in the form of magical ingredients. If you already possess enough materials to craft an item (one to one ratio in load), you can use those instead of paying.

**Weekly Expenses**

In contrast to other downtime activities, your weekly expenses are comprised of multiple factors, such as your normal expenses for living, access to a workstation, secondary ingredients, and other skilled artisans matching the Quality required for the type of item you want to craft.

| Item Quality | Weekly Expenses |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 10 coins / week |
| 2 | 20 coins / week |
| 3 | 50 coins / week |
| 4 | 200 coins / week |
| 5 | 1.000 coins / week |
| 6 | 5.000 coins / week |
| 7 | 25.000 coins / week |

**Making the Roll**

After selecting the type of item you want to create and determining it‘s cost, roll the crafting profession‘s skill test against the chosen item‘s Crafting Difficulty.

**Blunder.** Check 0 successes.

**Failure.** Check 0 successes or 1 success by doubling your weekly expenses.

**Weak.** Check 1 success.

**Strong.** Check 2 successes.

**Critical.** Check 3 successes.

> If you get enough successes in a single crafting activity to finish crafting multiple items of the same Quality, you can choose to do so. You still have to pay the material cost of all created items.
For example, you roll a strong success for a Q1 item. You can check 2 successes, but only require 1 for a Q1 item. You can then craft two Q1 instead, but still have to pay both of their material costs.
> 

Once you check the amount of successes required, pay the material cost and you have successfully created the item.

If you fail to reach the required amount of successes in a single downtime activity, you can use another activity to continue crafting that item and accumulate more successes over a longer period of time. This can be directly after the first crafting activity, or at some later point. Make sure to record your crafting progress in between. Each additional crafting activity will require you to pay the weekly expenses again.
