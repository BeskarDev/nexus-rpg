# 🎯 Challenges

![banner-img](/img/banner/scenes-banner.png)

Challenges provide a unified mechanic for chases, research, tracking, social intrigue, and any scene where progress must be measured against difficulty and urgency.

## What Is a Challenge?

A **Challenge** is a structured way to resolve a complex task or dramatic scene that requires multiple steps to complete. Instead of a single skill roll, a challenge tracks cumulative progress through a series of different rolls, each representing a meaningful attempt to overcome the obstacle.

### Constructing a Challenge (GM)

**Step 1: Define the Situation**

Identify the dramatic question the challenge answers:

- **What are the players trying to accomplish?** (Catch the thief, decipher the scroll, navigate the storm.)
- **What happens if they fail or run out of time?** (The thief escapes, the knowledge is lost, the ship sinks.)

**Step 2: Set the Length (Challenge Die)**

Choose a die size based on the narrative scope of the task. See [Dice Size](#dice-size) below.

**Step 3: Set the Difficulty (TN)**

Choose a TN based on the opposition, environment, and character tier. See [Difficulty](#difficulty) below.

**Step 4: Identify Applicable Skills**

List a few **skills** that are obvious fits for the challenge but still leave room for player creativity in choosing their own options.

**Step 5: Define Consequences**

Customize what happens on failures or blunders. Consequences can either occur directly after the failed roll (e.g. falling from a roof during a chase) or at the end when the challenge resolves (e.g. how many guards wait at the town's exit — more failures mean more guards).

### Running a Challenge

**Turn Order**

Challenges don't use strict Initiative like combat scenes. Instead:

- Each adventurer takes their turn in whatever order they like.
- After all adventurers have taken their turn, the round ends and a new round begins.

**Choosing a Skill**

During each adventurer's turn, they announce their intended action to help resolve the challenge:

- This can be an explicit ability provided by a talent, spell, or another game mechanic.
- Or it can be a purely narrative choice that isn't directly covered by the game rules.

In cooperation with the GM, they choose a specific **Attribute + Skill** combination to roll for. Each adventurer can use any individual skill only **once** during the entire challenge. This encourages creative problem-solving and varying approaches.

The roll's result influences the challenge's progress, either moving it forward or adding consequences for failure.

## Challenge Dice

A challenge uses a single die (or multiple dice for compound challenges) placed on the table showing its **maximum value**. This represents the total progress required to complete the challenge. It works similarly to Dice Timers, but the condition for reducing the die's value is different.

- Each **successful skill test** reduces the die value by 1.
- A **critical success** reduces the die value by 2.
- A **failure** or **blunder** adds a **consequence** immediately after the roll or at the end of the challenge.
- When the die reaches **0**, the challenge is completed. Resolve any open **consequences**.

The die is a visible, shared tracker — both the GM and players can see exactly how much progress remains.

> **Example**: A d6 chase challenge starts at 6. The ranger rolls a strong success and the die drops from 6 to 5. Next, the rogue rolls a critical success and the die drops from 5 to 3. Four more successes (or two critical successes) to go before finishing the challenge.

### Dice Size

The size of the challenge die represents **duration, distance, or complexity** in terms of the number of steps required, but **not** the difficulty of each individual step.

| **Die** | **Steps** | **Best For** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| d6 | 6 | Short, urgent tasks (quick escape, brief negotiation, short pursuit) |
| d8 | 8 | Standard challenges (typical chase, moderate research, standard tracking) |
| d10 | 10 | Extended challenges (complex investigation, long pursuit, deep negotiation) |
| d12 | 12 | Major undertakings (epic journey segments, grand rituals, political campaigns) |

### Difficulty

Difficulty is set entirely by the **Target Number** of the skill rolls, independent of the die size. The TN reflects the challenge's inherent difficulty and may scale with character level to remain relevant across tiers of play.

| **Difficulty (TN)** | **When to Use** |
| --- | --- |
| Medium (8) | Standard opposition, familiar terrain, cooperative NPCs |
| Hard (10) | Trained opposition, rough terrain, reluctant NPCs |
| Very Hard (12) | Expert opposition, hostile environment, antagonistic NPCs |
| Extreme (14) | Elite opposition, lethal conditions, powerful enemies |
| Legendary (16) | Near-impossible, mythic-scale obstacles, divine interference |

The GM announces the TN before the challenge begins so players can make informed decisions about their approach.

## Challenge Templates

The following templates are **plug-and-play** examples for common dramatic scenes. GMs should customize consequences, skills, and flavor to fit their specific situation.

---

### Chase

A pursuit through streets, wilderness, rooftops, or any terrain where one party tries to catch or escape another.

**Primary Skills**

Athletics, Perception, Survival (wilderness), Streetwise (urban)

**Secondary Skills**

Stealth (cut through shadows), Influence (shout for help to block the path), Nature (read animal trails)

**Consequences**

Each failure or blunder during a chase introduces an immediate setback or hazard. Roll or choose from the following examples:

- **Wrong Turn.** The pursuer or quarry ducks down an unfamiliar alley. The die value does not decrease on the next successful roll as the group doubles back.
- **Obstacle.** A cart overturns, a crowd surges, or debris litters the path. The affected adventurer suffers +1 bane on their next roll.
- **Lost Sight.** You lose visual on the target for a moment — they may have slipped into a building or crowd. The next roll must be made to re-acquire the trail before progress can resume; on a failure it does not count toward the challenge die.
- **Attracted Attention.** Your reckless sprint draws the eye of guards or bystanders. A patrol investigates; if the chase isn't resolved quickly, 1d4 guards will be waiting at the finish point.
- **Fatigue.** The grueling pace pushes one character to their limit. They suffer 1 Exhaustion immediately.
- **Environmental Hazard.** A low bridge, rooftop edge, or muddy slope catches someone off guard. The character must succeed on an Athletics check (TN 8) or take 1d6 damage from the fall or stumble.
- **Blunder — Crash.** The character careens into a market stall, innocent bystander, or structural fixture. They are knocked **prone**, suffer 1d6 damage, and the die value does not decrease this turn.

---

### Escape

Breaking free from captivity, fleeing a collapsing structure, or getting out of a dangerous area before it's too late.

**Primary Skills**

Athletics, Stealth, Crafting (improvised tools)

**Secondary Skills**

Streetwise (know the layout), Perception (spot weaknesses), Fighting (overpower a guard)

**Consequences**

Failures during an escape raise the alarm, close off exits, or endanger the group. Roll or choose from the following examples:

- **Alarm Triggered.** A stumble, a rattled chain, or a squeaking door puts the guards on high alert. The TN for all remaining rolls increases by 2 until the end of the challenge.
- **Guards Close In.** Pursuit narrows. One exit or route is now cut off; describe which path is blocked.
- **Lost Gear.** In the scramble, one adventurer drops or is forced to leave behind a piece of equipment (GM's choice or player's choice). It cannot be recovered until after the challenge.
- **Triggered Trap.** A floor tile, tripwire, or pressure plate fires. The triggering character suffers the trap's effect immediately (typically 1d6 damage and/or a condition such as **restrained**).
- **Blocked Exit.** The intended escape route is sealed — a door is locked, a tunnel has collapsed, or guards are stationed at the gate. The group must find an alternate path; the die value does not decrease this round while they reorient.
- **Injury.** A misstep in the dark, a desperate drop from a ledge, or a guard's parting blow deals 1d6 damage to one adventurer.
- **Blunder — Caught.** A character is seized by a guard, pinned under rubble, or cornered. They are captured or incapacitated and cannot contribute to the challenge until rescued by an ally (requiring one full success on a dedicated rescue roll).

---

### Tracking

Following a creature, person, or group through wilderness, urban environments, or hostile territory.

**Primary Skills**

Survival, Perception, Nature

**Secondary Skills**

Insight (predict behavior), Education (knowledge of species habits), Streetwise (urban tracking via informants)

**Consequences**

Failures during tracking cause the trail to go cold, the quarry to gain distance, or the trackers to expose themselves. Roll or choose from the following examples:

- **Lost Trail.** The tracks vanish — washed away by rain, obscured by heavy foot traffic, or deliberately concealed. The die value does not decrease on the next successful roll as time is spent re-acquiring the trail.
- **Misleading Signs.** The quarry has laid a false trail. The group wastes time before realizing it; the die value does not decrease this round, and the GM may introduce a minor hazard at the dead end.
- **Become Noticed.** The group has been spotted or heard while tracking. The quarry is now aware and becomes more cautious; the TN increases by 2 for all remaining rolls.
- **Environmental Hazard.** A hidden marsh, unstable slope, or biting weather catches the group off guard. Each adventurer must succeed on a Fortitude check (TN 8) or suffer 1 Exhaustion.
- **Target Gains Distance.** The quarry moves faster or more cleverly than anticipated. The die value increases by 1 (to a maximum of its starting value), representing lost ground.
- **Delay.** A false lead, ambiguous marking, or difficult terrain forces a cautious approach. No progress is made this round; all rolls this round have no effect on the challenge die.
- **Blunder — Ambush.** The quarry has circled back and is now hunting the hunters. The group walks into a prepared position of the quarry's choosing. Transition immediately into a combat scene or a new challenge.

---

### Social Intrigue

Navigating a tense negotiation, swaying a court, uncovering a conspiracy, or manipulating a social situation over multiple exchanges.

**Primary Skills**

Influence, Insight, Education (etiquette, law, history)

**Secondary Skills**

Stealth (plant evidence), Lore (invoke cultural precedent), Streetwise (leverage contacts), Perception (read the room)

**Consequences**

Failures in social intrigue damage reputations, raise suspicions, or cost the group valuable leverage. Roll or choose from the following examples:

- **Wrong Approach.** The character says something offensive, tone-deaf, or culturally inappropriate. The target NPC or faction becomes unfriendly; future Influence rolls against them suffer +1 bane for the rest of the challenge.
- **Inadvertent Revelation.** Under pressure, the character accidentally discloses something they shouldn't have — a secret plan, a contact's identity, or their true motive. The GM introduces a complication based on what was revealed.
- **Allies Lose Trust.** A supporting NPC or faction withdraws their backing after a poor showing. One allied NPC reduces their disposition by one step and their assistance is no longer available for this challenge.
- **Target Grows Suspicious.** The subject of the intrigue notices a contradiction, an inconsistency, or an overreach. The TN for all remaining rolls increases by 2.
- **Rumor Spreads.** Word of the group's misstep circulates. By the end of the session, a damaging rumor about the adventurers reaches an NPC or faction of the GM's choice.
- **Lost Leverage.** A piece of evidence, a bribe, or a promised favor is used up without producing the intended result. The group loses one resource or bargaining chip.
- **Blunder — Public Embarrassment.** The character causes a scene or commits a serious social violation. The group is ejected from the gathering, audience, or negotiation and cannot resume the challenge until they repair their standing (a separate downtime or social challenge).

---

### Research

Investigating a mystery, deciphering ancient texts, analyzing evidence, or uncovering hidden knowledge over time.

**Primary Skills**

Education, Lore, Arcana (magical research), Mysticism (divine/spiritual research)

**Secondary Skills**

Insight (connect disparate clues), Perception (notice overlooked details), Streetwise (find informants), Nature (botanical/ecological research)

**Consequences**

Failures during research waste time, corrupt evidence, or draw the attention of those who wish the knowledge to stay hidden. Roll or choose from the following examples:

- **Misinterpreted Clue.** The character draws the wrong conclusion from the available evidence. The GM secretly notes the incorrect interpretation; the group may act on false information until they discover the error.
- **False Lead.** An apparently promising thread turns out to be irrelevant or deliberately planted. The die value does not decrease this round as time is wasted chasing it down.
- **Damaged Evidence.** In the course of investigation, a fragile document, specimen, or artifact is accidentally harmed or destroyed. One piece of potentially useful information is permanently lost.
- **Attracted Unwanted Attention.** Asking the wrong questions or accessing restricted archives draws scrutiny. A faction or individual who wants this information suppressed sends someone to interfere; the GM introduces an NPC obstacle.
- **Resource Depletion.** Magical reagents are consumed, candle oil runs out, funds are exhausted on bribes, or the mental strain of intense study accumulates. The character suffers 1 Exhaustion, or the group loses a consumable resource of the GM's choice.
- **Dead End.** A key source — a sage, a library, a contact — is unavailable, destroyed, or refuses to cooperate. The group must find an alternative avenue; no progress is made this round.
- **Blunder — Dangerous Knowledge.** The character stumbles upon something they were not meant to find — a forbidden ritual, a cursed inscription, or a trap set by the original author. The character suffers an immediate consequence (1d6 psychic damage, a short-duration curse, or a triggered hostile encounter) at the GM's discretion.
