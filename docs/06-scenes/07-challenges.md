# 🎯 Challenges

![banner-img](/img/banner/scenes-banner.png)

Challenges provide a unified mechanic for chases, research, tracking, social intrigue, and any scene where progress must be measured against difficulty and urgency.

## What Is a Challenge?

A **Challenge** is a structured way to resolve a complex task or dramatic scene that requires multiple steps to complete. Instead of a single skill roll, a challenge tracks cumulative progress through a series of different rolls, each representing a meaningful attempt to overcome the obstacle.

### Constructing a Challenge (GM)

**Step 1: Define the Situation**

Identify the dramatic question the challenge answers:

- **What are the players trying to accomplish?** (Catch the thief, decipher the scroll, navigate the storm.)
- **What happens if they fail or run out of time?** (The thief escapes, the knowledge is lost, the ship sinks.)

**Step 2: Set the Length (Challenge Die)**

Choose a die size based on the narrative scope of the task. See [Dice Size](#dice-size) below.

**Step 3: Set the Difficulty (TN)**

Choose a TN based on the opposition, environment, and character tier. See [Difficulty](#difficulty) below.

**Step 4: Identify Applicable Skills**

List a few **skills** that are obvious fits for the challenge but still leave room for player creativity in choosing their own options.

**Step 5: Define Consequences**

Customize what happens on failures or blunders. Consequences can either occur directly after the failed roll (e.g. falling from a roof during a chase) or at the end when the challenge resolves (e.g. how many guards wait at the town's exit — more failures mean more guards).

### Running a Challenge

Challenges don't use strict Initiative like combat scenes. Adventurers take their turns in any order they choose; once everyone has acted, a new round begins.

On their turn, each adventurer announces an intended action and works with the GM to choose an **Attribute + Skill** combination to roll for. The action can be an explicit ability from a talent or spell, or a purely narrative choice not directly covered by the rules. Each adventurer may use any individual skill only **once** during the entire challenge, encouraging creative problem-solving and varied approaches.

The roll's result either advances the challenge toward completion or triggers a consequence on failure.

## Challenge Dice

A challenge uses a single die (or multiple dice for compound challenges) placed on the table showing its **maximum value**. This represents the total progress required to complete the challenge. It works similarly to Dice Timers, but the condition for reducing the die's value is different.

- Each **successful skill test** reduces the die value by 1.
- A **critical success** reduces the die value by 2.
- A **failure** or **blunder** adds a **consequence** immediately after the roll or at the end of the challenge.
- When the die reaches **0**, the challenge is completed. Resolve any open **consequences**.

The die is a visible, shared tracker — both the GM and players can see exactly how much progress remains.

> **Example**: A d6 chase challenge starts at 6. The ranger rolls a strong success and the die drops from 6 to 5. Next, the rogue rolls a critical success and the die drops from 5 to 3. Four more successes (or two critical successes) to go before finishing the challenge.

### Dice Size

The size of the challenge die represents **duration, distance, or complexity** in terms of the number of steps required, but **not** the difficulty of each individual step.

| **Die** | **Steps** | **Best For** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| d6 | 6 | Short, urgent tasks (quick escape, brief negotiation, short pursuit) |
| d8 | 8 | Standard challenges (typical chase, moderate research, standard tracking) |
| d10 | 10 | Extended challenges (complex investigation, long pursuit, deep negotiation) |
| d12 | 12 | Major undertakings (epic journey segments, grand rituals, political campaigns) |

### Difficulty

Difficulty is set entirely by the **Target Number** of the skill rolls, independent of the die size. The TN reflects the challenge's inherent difficulty and may scale with character level to remain relevant across tiers of play.

| **Difficulty (TN)** | **When to Use** |
| --- | --- |
| Medium (8) | Standard opposition, familiar terrain, cooperative NPCs |
| Hard (10) | Trained opposition, rough terrain, reluctant NPCs |
| Very Hard (12) | Expert opposition, hostile environment, antagonistic NPCs |
| Extreme (14) | Elite opposition, lethal conditions, powerful enemies |
| Legendary (16) | Near-impossible, mythic-scale obstacles, divine interference |

The GM announces the TN before the challenge begins so players can make informed decisions about their approach.

## Challenge Templates

The following templates are **plug-and-play** examples for common dramatic scenes. GMs should customize consequences, skills, and flavor to fit their specific situation.

---

### Chase

A pursuit through streets, wilderness, rooftops, or any terrain where one party tries to catch or escape another.

**Primary Skills**

Athletics, Perception, Survival (wilderness), Streetwise (urban)

**Secondary Skills**

Stealth (cut through shadows), Influence (shout for help to block the path), Nature (read animal trails)

**Consequences**

- **Wrong Turn.** The path doubles back. The die doesn't decrease on the next successful roll.
- **Obstacle.** A cart, crowd, or debris blocks the way. +1 bane on the next roll.
- **Attracted Attention.** The commotion draws a patrol. 1d4 guards are waiting at the finish point.
- **Fatigue.** The brutal pace forces one character to suffer 1 Exhaustion immediately.
- **Crash (Blunder).** The character careens into an obstacle, falls **prone**, and suffers 1d6 damage.

---

### Escape

Breaking free from captivity, fleeing a collapsing structure, or getting out of a dangerous area before it's too late.

**Primary Skills**

Athletics, Stealth, Crafting (improvised tools)

**Secondary Skills**

Streetwise (know the layout), Perception (spot weaknesses), Fighting (overpower a guard)

**Consequences**

- **Alarm Triggered.** The guards go on high alert. TN increases by 2 for all remaining rolls.
- **Exit Cut Off.** One route is blocked; the group must find another way.
- **Lost Gear.** One piece of equipment is dropped and can't be recovered until after the challenge.
- **Injury.** A misstep or guard's blow deals 1d6 damage to one adventurer.
- **Caught (Blunder).** A character is seized or cornered and can't act until rescued by an ally.

---

### Tracking

Following a creature, person, or group through wilderness, urban environments, or hostile territory.

**Primary Skills**

Survival, Perception, Nature

**Secondary Skills**

Insight (predict behavior), Education (knowledge of species habits), Streetwise (urban tracking via informants)

**Consequences**

- **Lost Trail.** The tracks vanish. The die doesn't decrease on the next successful roll.
- **Become Noticed.** The quarry is aware and grows cautious. TN increases by 2 for all remaining rolls.
- **Target Gains Distance.** The die value increases by 1 (up to its starting value).
- **Environmental Hazard.** Treacherous terrain: each adventurer makes a Fortitude check (TN 8) or suffers 1 Exhaustion.
- **Ambush (Blunder).** The quarry has circled back. Transition immediately into a combat scene.

---

### Social Intrigue

Navigating a tense negotiation, swaying a court, uncovering a conspiracy, or manipulating a social situation over multiple exchanges.

Social Intrigue uses additional parameters — **Interest**, **Patience**, **Motivations**, and **Pitfalls** — to give NPCs a visible stance and predictable behavior during the challenge. See [Social Intrigue](./08-social-intrigue.md) for the full rules.

**Additional Parameters**

- **Interest** (TN modifier): Derived from the NPC's disposition and how well the request aligns with their goals. Ranges from Eager (−2 TN) to Resistant (+2 TN). Changes when players appeal to Motivations (+1) or trigger Pitfalls (−1).
- **Patience** (timer die): A d4–d8 representing how many exchanges the NPC will tolerate. Ticks down with every roll, regardless of success or failure.
- **Motivations**: 2–3 GM-facing notes on what the NPC desires, fears, or values. Appealing to a Motivation raises Interest.
- **Pitfalls**: 1–2 GM-facing notes on what offends or alarms the NPC. Triggering a Pitfall lowers Interest.

**Primary Skills**

Influence, Insight, Education (etiquette, law, history)

**Secondary Skills**

Stealth (plant evidence), Lore (invoke cultural precedent), Streetwise (leverage contacts), Perception (read the room)

**Consequences**

- **Wrong Approach.** An offensive misstep turns the target hostile. +1 bane on all Influence rolls for the rest of the challenge.
- **Inadvertent Revelation.** The character lets slip something they shouldn't. The GM introduces a complication.
- **Target Grows Suspicious.** A contradiction is noticed. TN increases by 2 for all remaining rolls.
- **Rumor Spreads.** A damaging rumor about the adventurers reaches a faction of the GM's choice.
- **Ejected (Blunder).** The character commits a serious social violation and the group is removed from the gathering until they repair their standing.

---

### Research

Investigating a mystery, deciphering ancient texts, analyzing evidence, or uncovering hidden knowledge over time.

**Primary Skills**

Education, Lore, Arcana (magical research), Mysticism (divine/spiritual research)

**Secondary Skills**

Insight (connect disparate clues), Perception (notice overlooked details), Streetwise (find informants), Nature (botanical/ecological research)

**Consequences**

- **False Lead.** Time is wasted on an irrelevant thread. The die doesn't decrease this round.
- **Misinterpreted Clue.** The group acts on false information until the error is uncovered.
- **Damaged Evidence.** A fragile document or artifact is destroyed. One piece of information is permanently lost.
- **Attracted Attention.** Asking the wrong questions draws scrutiny. A hostile faction sends someone to interfere.
- **Dangerous Knowledge (Blunder).** The character stumbles onto something forbidden — a cursed inscription or a trap left by the original author. They suffer 1d6 psychic damage or gain a short-duration curse.
