# ðŸŽ­ Scenes & Time Intervals

![banner-img](/img/banner/scenes-banner.png)

When you play this game, you do so in separate scenes which each fall into one of the following time intervals. Which time interval you are in with your scene depends on the speed and scope of your group's current storytelling.

> **How do I know when a scene begins or ends?**
A scene begins once the adventurers encounter a specific situation with a specific goal they want to achieve or avert. The scene ends once that goal is reached or is made impossible. In other words, once the adventurers have the option to take a break and re-evaluate their next steps, a previous scene has probably ended.
The most simple example are combat scenes, which begin once the combatants encounter each other and start fighting. The scene ends when the adventurers defeat their foes, have to flee, or are defeated.
> 

Each time interval has its own definition of a turn, which is a period a single action for the current time interval takes. Turns help to keep the story moving along and not dragging down. You can generally do things that take a lot less time than your current time interval turns without needing a whole turn to do them.

Different abilities call for these time interval turns to determine the duration or execution time of an effect or ability.

During more stretched-out portions of play, you might skip turns to progress the story naturally. You might also want to end certain scenes early when their outcome is certain and just narrate the end of it shortly. For example when the winners of a combat are already determined, but some enemies remain. Instead of going through the motions, without any remaining danger of losing, that combat can just end and the adventurers decide what they do with those remaining enemies.

## Encounter

Any situation in which moment-to-moment actions matter and every few seconds can count. Can either be combats against enemies, or more indirect struggles, such as a chase or escape.

Encounter scenes are counted in seconds. One encounter turn usually covers about 5-10 seconds.

They are also generally more rigorous and less free-flowing than those of other time intervals. Therefore actions during combat are described in more detail in their own rules section.

### Encounter Activities

- Any combat action
- Sprint a short distance
- Throw over a pile of crates
- Quickly look out for danger
- Attack with a weapon
- Jump over a narrow chasm
- â€¦

## Delving

The act of carefully traversing an unknown space, looking out for traps and hidden enemies. This can be in the corridors and rooms of a dungeon, or through other environments.

Delving scenes are counted in minutes. One delving turn usually covers about 5-10 minutes.

### Delving Activities

- Take a short break
- Move from one room to the next
- Search a room
- Pick the lock of a door or container
- Disable a trap
- Sneak around a group of hostile creatures
- Have a short conversation
- â€¦

## Exploration

When you travel through an environment with an unknown or hidden destination you attempt to reach. For example, when tracking through a forest to reach an old watchtower, which has been abandoned for decades.

Exploration scenes are counted in hours. One exploration turn usually covers about 2-4 hour.

### Exploration Activities

- Navigate through a local natural environment
- Track down a creature
- Build a quick construction
- Decipher the meaning of hieroglyphics, runes, or other uncommon scripts
- Set up camp and take a nightâ€™s rest (multiple exploration turns)
- â€¦

## Travel

Whenever you traverse large distances by sea or land. While exploration deals with finding an unknown location, travel generally deals with a known (and maybe even highly documented) destination. There might be developed roads with settlements along them to guide you, or you have to travel by stars through an immense desert. Also use the scope of travel turns for staying in one area for a longer time, doing some continuous activity.

Travel scenes are counted in days. One travel turn usually covers about one or more days.

### Travel Activities

- Hike a day-long route
- Hunt for game or forage in a local area
- Gather supplies for the journey
- Navigate through challenging terrain
- Take a full rest
- â€¦

First, determine your destination for travel. The time it takes to predictably reach that target determines the amount of resources required. A journey longer than two weeks canâ€˜t be supplied by what you can carry anymore, you will need to find provisions in the wild, or carry transportation for large amounts of rations with you. A journey can also consist of different stretched of travel, if the circumstances or terrain changed drastically on the way. 

| Time Traveled | A day | a few days | a week | two weeks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Food Consumed | roll a Supply Check | 1 unit | 2 units | 4 units |
| Water Consumed* | roll a Supply Check | 1 unit | 2 units | 4 units |

* The provision consumption is doubled for very hot climates, because of the increases need for water.

At the start of travel, you must determine who in your group takes on one of the following roles: Navigator (mandatory), Scout (mandatory), Forager (optional), Hunter (optional), or Fisher (optional). One adventurer can also take over multiple roles, but suffers +1 bane on their travel rolls for each roll they take beyond the first. In a similar manner, multiple members of the group can take over the same role (expect navigating). Only one of them rolls the test, but gains +1 boon for everyone else participating.

### Navigator

*Using their knowledge of geography, terrain, and weather patterns, the Navigator guides the party through treacherous landscapes and helps them avoid obstacles and hazards along the way.*

This role is mandatory for travel. Roll Spirit + Nature.

**Blunder.** Choose two from â€žoff courseâ€œ, â€žcomplicationsâ€œ, or â€žslowed downâ€œ.
**Failure**. Choose one instead.
**Weak.** Choose one from â€žfast paceâ€œ, â€žunexhaustedâ€œ, or â€žwell on trackâ€œ.
**Strong.** Choose two instead.
**Critical.** Choose all three instead.

#### Outcomes

- â€žoff courseâ€œ: You are lost and need to retrace your steps. Your group suffers +1 bane on the next navigation roll.
- â€žcomplicationsâ€œ: The GM determines a complication your group encounters, such as bad weather, dangerous terrain, or something else entirely.
- â€žslowed downâ€œ: Reduce the distance traveled by one step, or increase the time taken for a set distance.
- â€žfast paceâ€œ: Increase the distance traveled by one step, or reduce the time taken for a set distance.
- â€žunexhausedâ€œ: Your group gains +1 boon on the Strength + Fortitude roll at the end of travel.
- â€žwell on trackâ€œ: You have chosen your route well, making it easier to continue. Your group gains +1 boon on the next navigation roll.

### Scout

*Through stealth and reconnaissance, the Scout is able to move quickly and quietly through the wilds, alerting the party to any potential dangers ahead.*

This role is mandatory for travel. Roll Spirit + Perception.

**Blunder.** Choose both from â€žsurprisedâ€œ, â€žunwanted attentionâ€œ.
**Failure**. Choose one instead.
**Weak.** Choose one from â€žfind shelterâ€œ, â€žavoid dangerâ€œ, and â€žmake a discoveryâ€œ.
**Strong.** Choose two.
**Critical.** Choose all three.

#### Outcomes

- â€žsurprisedâ€œ: When starting an encounter, the group is unaware of the danger and suffers +1 bane on their Initiative roll.
- â€žunwanted attentionâ€œ: Increase the Event Die by one step (max. d12).
- â€žfind shelterâ€œ: If you also carry a camping kit and have enough provisions, you avoid a bad night.
- â€žavoid dangerâ€œ: Decrease the Event Die by one step (min. d4).
- â€žmake a discoveryâ€œ: You find something or someone useful. This might be a caravan of traders able to fill up your supplies, a secret cache of coins, or a good spot for one of your foragers, hunters, or fisher, granting them +1 boon on their roll.

### Forager

*Identifying and gathering edible plants and other resources, the Forager ensures the party always has enough food and supplies to keep going.*

Roll Mind + Nature.

**Strong.** Roll a Supply Check* instead of consuming both one unit of provisions. You also find one unit of materials, or medicinal herbs (your choice).
**Critical.** Consume one less unit of provisions. You also find one unit of materials and medicinal herbs.

### Hunter

*Equipped with a sharp eye and a deadly aim, the Hunter tracks and takes down wild game to provide sustenance for the party.*

While traveling in a region with game available, you can roll a Spirit + Survival test.

**Blunder.** Increase the Event Die by one step (max. d12).
**Weak.** Roll a Supply Check* instead of automatically consuming one unit of provisions.
**Strong.** Consume one less unit of provisions.
**Critical.** Consume two less units of provisions. If this leads to a surplus of provisions, instead gain the amount of provisions units not consumed.

### Fisher

*Whether wading in a stream or setting up traps along the shoreline, the Fisher provides the party with a reliable source of fresh fish to supplement their diet.*

While traveling with fishing tools and fitting lakes or rivers on your way, roll Spirit + Survival.

**Weak.** Roll a Supply Check* instead of automatically consuming one unit of provisions.
**Strong.** Consume one less unit of provisions.
**Critical.** Consume one less unit of provisions. Roll a Supply Check* instead of automatically consuming another one unit of provisions.

* If you already only had to roll a Supply Check anyway, instead skip it and donâ€˜t consume that unit.

### Ending Travel

First, the adventurers must roll the Event Die. The size of the die is based on the environment, that the adventurers moved through and the results of their rolls during travel. The result of the die determines the nature of a noteworthy event during the adventurers travels, or nothing happens at all. The GM will describe the event.

| Event Die Result | Event Type | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (good) | Something lucky, pleasant, or helpful. | A lost treasure trove, or stumble upon a rare herb with medicinal properties. |
| 2-3 (neutral) | Nothing interesting. | Seeing a beautiful sunset, or coming across a small village |
| 4-6 (bad) | Something dubious, or potentially harmful. | Coming across a ruined village with signs of recent violence, or encounter a group of hostile bandits demanding a toll. |
| 7-9 (perilous) | Something violent, aggressive, or hurtful. | Ambushed by a pack of hungry wolves, or fall into a hidden pit trap. |
| 10-11 (dire) | Something very dangerous, or terrifying. | Find yourself lost in a treacherous maze, or encounter a wild evil spirit or undead creature. |
| 12 (catastrophic) | Something unbelievably bad, evil, or a great misfortune. | A dragon flying overhead spots and chases you, or spotting a large hostile war band marching in your direction. |

At the end of traveling, reduce your supplies according to the results of rolls made.

Also everybody in the group needs to roll Strength + Fortitude for how much the journey wore you out. If the scout couldnâ€™t find shelter, suffer +1 bane on the roll. On a failure, you suffer one Fatigue.

Downtime scenes are counted in weeks. One downtime turn usually covers one week.

### Downtime Activities

- Craft an item
- Research a complex topic
- Recover from wounds
- Train a skill
