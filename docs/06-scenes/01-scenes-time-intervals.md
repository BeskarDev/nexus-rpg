# ðŸŽ­ Scenes & Time Intervals

When you play this game, you do so in separate scenes which each fall into one of the following time intervals. Which time interval you are in with your scene depends on the speed and scope of your groups current storytelling.

Each time interval has their own definition of a turn, which is a span of time a single action for the current time interval takes. Turns help to keep the story moving along and not dragging down. You can generally do things which take a lot less time that your current time intervals turns without needing a whole turn to do them.

Different abilities call for these time interval turns to determine the duration or execution time of an effect or ability.

During more stretched out portions of play, you might skip turns to progress the story naturally. You might also want to end that certain scenes early when their outcome is certain and just narrate the end of it shortly. For example when the winners of a combat are already determined, but some enemies remain. Instead of going through the motions, without any remaining danger of loosing, that combat can just end and the adventurers decide what they do with those remaining enemies.

## Encounter

Any situation in which moment-to-moment actions matter and every few seconds can count. Can either be combats against enemies, or more indirect struggles, such as a chase or escape.

Encounter scenes are counted in seconds.

They are also generally more rigorous and less free-flowing than those of other time intervals. Therefore actions during combat are described in more detail in their own rules section.

Use an Encounter turn to:

- Sprint a short distance
- Throw over a pile of crates
- Quickly look out for danger
- Attack with a weapon
- Jump over a narrow chasm

Encounter Scenes are Skill Challenges

- pick a type of Encounter Scene (chase, fleeing, parkour, disabling a trap, â€¦)
- pick a Difficulty (it determines the amount of successes the group needs for the scene) (Easy: 3, Moderate: 5, Hard: 7, Very Hard: 9, Extremely Hard: 11)
- each adventurer continually rolls a skill check in Initiative order to potentially collect successes
- the scene runs on a timer, which ticks down
- If the timer runs out, or the group collects all necessary successes, the scene is over
- Depending on the amount of successes, the scene has a different outcome

## Delving

The act of carefully traversing an unknown space, looking out for traps and hidden enemies. This can be in the corridors and rooms of a dungeon, or through other environments.

Delving scenes are counted in minutes.

Use a Delving turn for one of the following Activities:

- take a short break
- move from room to room
- search a room
- investigate a suspicious object
- lock pick a door or container
- disable a trap
- sneak around a group of hostile creatures
- have a conversation
- eliminate an enemy
    - Roll an attack against a basic enemy. On a success, the enemy immediately takes an Injury and dies.

After 6 delving turns carrying an active light source, roll a Supply check for it.

## Exploration

When you travel though an environment with a unknown or hidden destination you attempt to reach. For example, when tracking through a forest to reach an old watchtower, which has been abandoned for decades.

Exploration scenes are counted in hours.

Use an Exploration turn for one of the following Activities:

- navigate through an environment without clear directions
- track down a creature
- build a quick construction, such as a camp
- decipher the meaning of a wall of hieroglyphics
- setting up camp (requires a camping kit for each person, something to eat, and drink)
    - at the end of the day, somebody must roll Spirit + Perception to find suitable shelter for a camp
    - making a camp without suitable shelter increases the risk of nightly encounters

After each Exploration turn carrying an active light source, you automatically lose one unit of it.

Each day consists of 4 Exploration turns (morning, noon, afternoon, evening). After those 4 turns, the group needs to establish a camp for the night, or decide to do a forced march and skip resting for the night (this adds another 2 Exploration turns until the next morning).

## Travel

Whenever you traverse large distances by sea or land. While exploration deals with finding an unknown location, travel generally deals with a known (and maybe even highly documented) destination. There might be developed roads with settlements along them to guide you, or you have to travel by stars through a immense desert. Also use the scope of travel turns for staying in one area for a longer time, doing some continuous activity.

Travel scenes are counted in days.

First, determine your destination for travel. The time it takes to predictably reach that target determines the amount of resources required. A journey longer than two weeks canâ€˜t be supplied by what you can carry anymore, you will need to find provisions in the wild, or carry transportation for large amounts of rations with you. A journey can also consist of different stretched of travel, if the circumstances or terrain changed drastically on the way. 

| Time Traveled | A day | a few days | a week | two weeks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Food Consumed | roll a Supply Check | 1 unit | 2 units | 4 units |
| Water Consumed* | roll a Supply Check | 1 unit | 2 units | 4 units |

* The provision consumption is doubled for very hot climates, because of the increases need for water.

At the start of travel, you must determine who in your group takes on one of the following roles: Navigator (mandatory), Scout (mandatory), Forager (optional), Hunter (optional), or Fisher (optional). One adventurer can also take over multiple roles, but suffers +1 bane on their travel rolls for each roll they take beyond the first. In a similar manner, multiple members of the group can take over the same role (expect navigating). Only one of them rolls the test, but gains +1 boon for everyone else participating.

### Navigator

*Using their knowledge of geography, terrain, and weather patterns, the Navigator guides the party through treacherous landscapes and helps them avoid obstacles and hazards along the way.*

This role is mandatory for travel. Roll Spirit + Nature.

- â€žslowed downâ€œ: Reduce the distance traveled by one step, or increase the time taken for a set distance.
- â€žfast paceâ€œ: Increase the distance traveled by one step, or reduce the time taken for a set distance.
- â€žunexhausedâ€œ: Your group gains +1 boon on the Strength + Fortitude roll at the end of travel.
- â€žwell on trackâ€œ: You have chosen your route well, making it easier to continue. Your group gains +1 boon on the next navigation roll.

### Scout

*Through stealth and reconnaissance, the Scout is able to move quickly and quietly through the wilds, alerting the party to any potential dangers ahead.*

This role is mandatory for travel. Roll Spirit + Perception.

**Strong.** Choose two.
**Critical.** Choose all three.

#### Outcomes

- â€žsurprisedâ€œ: When starting an encounter, the group is unaware of the danger and suffers +1 bane on their Initiative roll.

- â€žfind shelterâ€œ: If you also carry a camping kit and have enough provisions, you avoid a bad night.
- â€žavoid dangerâ€œ: Decrease the Event Die by one step (min. d4).
- â€žmake a discoveryâ€œ: You find something or someone useful. This might be a caravan of traders able to fill up your supplies, a secret cache of coins, or a good spot for one of your foragers, hunters, or fisher, granting them +1 boon on their roll.

**Blunder.** Increase the Event Die by one step (max. d12).
**Weak.** Roll a Supply Check* instead of automatically consuming one unit of provisions.
**Strong.** Consume one less unit of provisions.
**Critical.** Consume two less units of provisions. If this leads to a surplus of provisions, instead gain the amount of provisions units not consumed.

**Strong.** Consume one less unit of provisions.
**Critical.** Consume one less unit of provisions. Roll a Supply Check* instead of automatically consuming another one unit of provisions.

* If you already only had to roll a Supply Check anyway, instead skip it and donâ€˜t consume that unit.

### Ending Travel

First, the adventurers must roll the Event Die. The size of the die is based on the environment, that the adventurers moved through and the results of their rolls during travel. The result of the die determines the nature of a noteworthy event during the adventurers travels, or nothing happens at all. The GM will describe the event.

| Event Die Result | Event Type | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (good) | Something lucky, pleasant, or helpful. | A lost treasure trove, or stumble upon a rare herb with medicinal properties. |
| 2-3 (neutral) | Nothing interesting. | Seeing a beautiful sunset, or coming across a small village |
| 4-6 (bad) | Something dubious, or potentially harmful. | Coming across a ruined village with signs of recent violence, or encounter a group of hostile bandits demanding a toll. |
| 7-9 (perilous) | Something violent, aggressive, or hurtful. | Ambushed by a pack of hungry wolves, or fall into a hidden pit trap. |
| 10-11 (dire) | Something very dangerous, or terrifying. | Find yourself lost in a treacherous maze, or encounter a wild evil spirit or undead creature. |
| 12 (catastrophic) | Something unbelievably bad, evil, or a great misfortune. | A dragon flying overhead spots and chases you, or spotting a large hostile war band marching in your direction. |

At the end of traveling, reduce your supplies according to the results of rolls made.

Also everybody in the group needs to roll Strength + Fortitude for how much the journey wore you out. If the scout couldnâ€™t find shelter, suffer +1 bane on the roll. On a failure, you suffer one Fatigue.


## Downtime

The most relaxed span of time where you hang around in some settlement, doing some kind of long form activity.

Downtime scenes are counted in weeks.

Use a Downtime turn for one of the following Activities:

- look for information
- sell items
- find and buy items
- find contacts for your next adventure (boons with wretched/poor lifestyle for shady contacts, and with wealthy/rich lifestyle for high society contacts)

- treat your wounds at a temple (costs coins, requires at least a comfortable lifestyle)
    - you lose all wounds after one week without rolling
- pickpocket
    - choose a level of risk. on a success, you gain coins equal to smaller loot of the level of risk you chose. on a failure, you get beat up, put in prison, or worse.

### Settlements

#### Advancement

1. Primitive
2. Village
3. Town
4. City

### Lifestyle

Your lifestyle determines how well you treat yourself during downtime. This affects certain downtime actions and in what condition you start your next adventure with.

If you live with the same lifestyle for the entirety of your downtime until your next adventure, you apply their adventure effect on yourself at the start of it. If you switch between multiple lifestyles during your downtime, determine the relative amount of time you spend with each lifestyle and apply the adventure effects of the lifestyle that best describes the average quality of your lifestyle. For example, during a downtime of 4 weeks in which you lived with a decent lifestyle for 2 weeks and with a wretched lifestyle for another 2 weeks, your average lifestyle quality would be poor. Therefore, you would roll Strength + Fortitude before the adventure starts, to see if you catched some disease during your downtime.

> Note that the cost per week is based on relying on an inn or similar short term establishment for food and shelter. If the adventurers possess their own home, it will cut their living cost by half or more.
> 

| Lifestyle | Description | Cost per Week | Adventure Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Wretched | Extreme poverty and hardship.  | 0 coins | Roll a hard Strength + Fortitude test. On a failure, you suffer one major disease (TODO you permanently suffer some major condition). |
| Poor | Limited resources and access to necessities. | 10 coins | Roll Strength + Fortitude. On a failure, you suffer one minor disease (TODO you permanently suffer some minor condition). |
| Decent | Enough resources to meet basic needs. | 20 coins | - |
| Comfortable | Relative ease and stability, with some disposable income and simple luxury items. | 50 coins | Start your next adventure with 1 Resolve |
| Wealthy | Significant financial resources and the ability to live a life of comfort and extravagance. | 200 coins | Start your next adventure with 2 Resolve |
| Rich | Access to the finest luxuries and abundant resources. | 500 coins | Start your next adventure with 3 Resolve |
