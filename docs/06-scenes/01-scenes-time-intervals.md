# 🎭 Scenes & Time Scales

![banner-img](/img/banner/scenes-banner.png)

Every session unfolds through a series of **scenes** — distinct moments of tension, decision, and consequence. Each scene has a clear goal and some obstacle standing in the way, and it plays out at a **time scale** that reflects the pace of the action: a desperate battle plays out second by second, while an overland journey is measured in days.

Time scales tell everyone at the table how much time each action takes, keeping the fiction grounded and the pacing sharp. The GM doesn't need to enforce scene boundaries rigidly — they are a tool for framing the story, not a strict procedural requirement.

## Scenes

A scene begins when the adventurers face a situation with a clear goal and ends once that goal is achieved, made impossible, or the group can step back and reassess. A battle, a tense negotiation, a dangerous descent through a ruin — each is its own scene with its own rhythm. Scenes don't have to be called out explicitly; they emerge naturally from play.

> **How do I know when a scene begins or ends?**
> A scene begins once the adventurers encounter a specific situation with a specific goal they want to achieve or avert. The scene ends once that goal is reached or is made impossible. In other words, once the adventurers have the option to take a break and re-evaluate their next steps, a previous scene has probably ended.
> The most simple example are combat scenes, which begin once the combatants encounter each other and start fighting. The scene ends when the adventurers defeat their foes, have to flee, or are defeated.

## Time Scales

Each scene operates in exactly one of the following time scales. Each Action the adventurers perform during a scene takes the designated amount of time.

| **Time Scale** | **One Action** | **Examples of Actions** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Encounter | 5–10 seconds | Attack, cast a spell, dash, use an item |
| Delving | 5–10 minutes | Search a room, pick a lock, disable a trap, move to the next room |
| Exploration | 2–4 hours | Navigate a stretch of wilderness, track a creature, set up camp |
| Travel | ~1 day | Hike a full day's route, forage/hunt for the day, rest and resupply |
| Downtime | ~1 week | Craft an item, research a topic, train a skill, gather rumors |

### What Is Free

Activities that take **significantly less time** than the current time scale are free. They do not count as an Action.

| **Time Scale** | **Free Activities** |
| --- | --- |
| Encounter | Speak a short sentence, drop an item, glance around |
| Delving | Brief conversation, pull an item from a backpack, peek through a doorway |
| Exploration | Short discussion, check a map, eat a quick meal |
| Travel | Brief rest stop, conversation while walking, consult notes |
| Downtime | Run an errand, visit a shop, have a meeting |

> **Rule of Thumb**: If you would not narrate it as a separate scene beat or a player would not expect to "spend their turn" on it, it is free. Repeated "free" activities may still count as a full Action in the scene, depending on the GM's judgement.

## Dice Timers

A **Dice Timer** is a countdown that measures how many major actions remain before an event occurs in the current scene. Use it to provide pacing and urgency to a scene. The dice timer should physically be visible by everyone and used as a shared token between the players and the GM.

- **Starting Value**: The GM sets the timer at the beginning of a scene. Typically a d6 (d4 for urgent scenes), starting at 6.
- **Tick Down**: Each major action by the whole group (one turn's worth of activity) reduces the timer by 1.
- **Trigger**: When the timer reaches 0, either an event predetermined by the GM occurs or the **Event Die** is rolled.
- **Visibility**: The timer is a shared resource. Both the GM and players know its current value.

### The Action Loop

When the group undertakes a major Action governed by a timer, follow this standardized order:

1. **Tick**: Reduce the scene's dice timer by 1.
2. **Roll/Act**: Make the relevant roll(s) or execute the Action (search, fight, disarm, negotiate, etc.).
3. **Results**: Apply results and consequences of the Action. If the timer hits 0, resolve its trigger and reset it back to the starting value (or remove the dice timer if the urgency of the scene is over).

> **Example wording at the table**: "I want to search the room for treasure. That ticks the timer down by 1 (from 4 to 3). Now I roll Spirit + Perception..."

### The Event Die

When a dice timer hits 0, roll **1d6** on the scene's event table to determine what happens. All time scales follow the same structure:

| **d6** | **Category** | **What It Means** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Threat** | An encounter or direct danger. Roll on an encounter table or introduce a hostile force. |
| 2 | **Wear and Tear** | Equipment or resources degrade. Each adventurer must choose one item they possess. Items that track Durability require a Durability check; other items lose 1 use. |
| 3 | **Resource Drain** | A key resource is consumed or tested. Roll a Supply check or suffer 1 Fatigue. Ammo, light source, rations, extreme climate, or overexertion. |
| 4 | **Shift** | The environment or situation changes, introducing some lasting effect. Terrain, weather, conditions, or NPC behavior. |
| 5 | **Traces** | A clue or sign of what lies ahead. Foreshadowing, tracks, sounds, or useful information. |
| 6 | **Ambient** | Atmosphere and flavor. Nothing significant happens. |

> Each time scale provides its own themed example version of this table (see below). GMs are encouraged to customize these tables further for specific adventures or locations.

**Example Encounter Event Table (d6)**

| **d6** | **Event** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **Reinforcements!** More enemies arrive or an existing threat escalates. Roll on an encounter table or add 1d4 combatants to the opposing side. |
| 2 | **Wear and Tear.** The chaos of battle damages something. Each combatant chooses one held or worn item: it requires a Durability check or loses 1 use. |
| 3 | **Resource Strain.** A critical resource is consumed or threatened. A light source gutters, ammunition is scattered, or a consumable is knocked loose and must be recovered. |
| 4 | **Battlefield Shift.** The environment changes. Roll d3: [1] Cover collapses or terrain becomes difficult. [2] A new hazard appears (fire, falling debris, flooding). [3] An exit or path opens or closes. |
| 5 | **Opening.** A momentary advantage appears. A weak point in the enemy formation, an unguarded flank, or a piece of useful terrain becomes apparent. |
| 6 | **Ambient.** Dust swirls, thunder rumbles, or the ground trembles. Atmosphere, but nothing mechanically significant. |

**Example Delving Event Table (d6)**

| **d6** | **Event** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **Attack!** Roll on the encounter table to see which creatures attack and how. |
| 2 | **Wear and Tear.** Each adventurer chooses one item they hold, carry, or wear: worn equipment or weapons require a Durability check, other items directly lose 1 use. |
| 3 | **Light Fades.** Roll a Supply check to light a new torch or refill lantern oil. |
| 4 | **Delve Shift.** The dungeon breathes. Roll on a delve shift table to see what changes and what the mechanical effect is (e.g., water rises, temperature drops, passages shift). |
| 5 | **Traces.** You find signs of a nearby encounter or a clue about your surroundings. |
| 6 | **Ambient.** Some ambient effect, but nothing else happens. |

**Example Exploration Event Table (d6)**

| **d6** | **Event** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **Encounter!** A creature or group crosses your path. Roll on a terrain-appropriate encounter table to determine what appears and its disposition. |
| 2 | **Wear and Tear.** The terrain takes its toll. Each adventurer chooses one item: footwear, clothing, or a carried tool requires a Durability check, or a carried item loses 1 use. |
| 3 | **Provisions Dwindle.** Rations spoil, waterskins leak, or foraging turns up nothing. Roll a Supply check for provisions or water. |
| 4 | **Terrain Shift.** The environment changes around you. Roll d3: [1] Weather worsens (next check suffers +1 bane). [2] A path is blocked or flooded (detour required). [3] A natural hazard emerges (rockslide, sinkhole, flash flood). |
| 5 | **Traces.** You discover tracks, markings, old campsites, or other signs that hint at what lies ahead or nearby. |
| 6 | **Ambient.** Wind through the trees, birdsong, distant thunder. Atmosphere and scenery, but nothing significant occurs. |

**Example Travel Event Table (d6)**

| **d6** | **Event** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **Encounter!** You cross paths with creatures, travelers, or a hostile force. Roll on a region-appropriate encounter table to determine what you meet. |
| 2 | **Wear and Tear.** Long days on the road strain gear. Each adventurer chooses one item: worn armor, weapons, or tools require a Durability check, or a pack item loses 1 use. |
| 3 | **Provisions Dwindle.** Food runs low, water sources dry up, or stored rations go bad. Roll a Supply check for provisions. |
| 4 | **Route Shift.** Conditions change along the route. Roll d3: [1] Weather turns harsh (next day's travel suffers +1 bane). [2] A road or bridge is damaged or blocked (detour adds time). [3] Terrain becomes more difficult than expected (reduce progress). |
| 5 | **Traces.** Signs of other travelers, old markers, animal migrations, or distant smoke hint at what lies ahead or off the beaten path. |
| 6 | **Ambient.** A striking sunset, a cool breeze, or a peaceful night. Atmosphere and flavor, but nothing of note occurs. |

**Example Downtime Event Table (d6)**

| **d6** | **Event** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **Trouble!** A rival acts, a threat materializes, or an obligation comes due. Roll on a settlement or faction event table to determine what demands your attention. |
| 2 | **Wear and Tear.** Tools, workspace, or living conditions degrade. A crafting tool, workshop item, or piece of equipment requires a Durability check or loses 1 use. |
| 3 | **Expenses.** Costs rise or income drops. Pay an unexpected fee or suffer 1 Fatigue (can only be removed after situation improves again). |
| 4 | **Situation Shift.** The political, social, or economic landscape changes. Roll d3: [1] A faction gains or loses power. [2] Prices or availability of goods shift. [3] A new law, rumor, or decree changes the status quo. |
| 5 | **Traces.** You hear rumors, receive a lead, or notice a pattern that hints at coming events or hidden opportunities. |
| 6 | **Ambient.** A festival, a quiet week, or pleasant weather. Life goes on, nothing of particular note occurs. |
