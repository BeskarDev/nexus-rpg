# 🗺️ Travel Overview

![banner-img](/img/banner/scenes-banner.png)

> "The journey itself is the adventure. Every league traveled brings new challenges, unexpected encounters, and tests of endurance that separate the merely ambitious from the truly legendary."
> 

The travel system transforms long journeys into engaging adventures filled with meaningful choices, resource management, and unexpected challenges. Rather than simply fast-forwarding to your destination, travel becomes a series of tense decisions where the choices you make—your pace, route, preparation, and roles—directly impact your chances of success.

## Core Principles

The travel system is built on these foundations:

**Journeys Are Adventures** - Every multi-day journey carries risk and opportunity. The wilderness is alive with dangers and wonders that make reaching your destination an achievement worth celebrating.

**Choices Matter** - Players make meaningful decisions about pace versus safety, resource management versus speed, and known routes versus shortcuts. Each choice creates trade-offs and consequences.

**Resources Create Tension** - Managing food, water, fatigue, and time pressure forces difficult decisions. Do you push through exhaustion to reach safety, or rest and risk running out of supplies?

**Roles Enable Teamwork** - Every party member can contribute through specialized travel roles, from navigation to foraging to scouting ahead. Success depends on coordinated effort.

**Randomness Adds Drama** - Daily encounters and weather events introduce unpredictability while player choices and preparation influence the odds and outcomes.

## When to Use the Travel System

Use the full travel system when:

- **The journey takes multiple days** through wilderness, desert, mountains, or other challenging terrain
- **Resources and time matter** - the party needs to manage supplies and can't simply teleport or fast-travel
- **The journey itself should feel like an adventure** with potential dangers, discoveries, and challenges

Skip or simplify the travel system when:

- **The journey is short** (less than a day) or through safe, civilized areas
- **Travel is not narratively important** to the current story
- **Time pressure requires fast-forwarding** to the next important scene
- **The party has reliable magical transportation** that bypasses normal travel challenges

## Overview of the Travel System

The complete travel system consists of several interconnected subsystems:

### Route Planning

Before departing, the party and GM work together to plan the route:

1. **Define origin and destination** on the campaign map
2. **Map the route through terrain segments** - break the journey into distinct terrain types
3. **Estimate segment lengths** based on map scale and terrain
4. **Calculate expected travel time** based on terrain, pace, and party capabilities
5. **Identify waypoints** - settlements, landmarks, or camps along the route

See **Route Planning** for detailed procedures.

### Progress Track

The progress track represents the journey's length and how far you've traveled:

- **Progress boxes** represent segments of the journey (typically 1 box = 1 day of travel)
- **Daily progress rolls** determine how many boxes you mark off
- **Terrain and pace** modify progress rates
- **Reaching waypoints** provides opportunities to resupply and rest safely

See **Progress Track** for the complete system.

### Daily Travel Procedure

Each travel day follows this sequence:

1. **Morning: Set pace and assign roles** - Choose normal, fast, or slow pace. Assign travel roles.
2. **Midday: Make progress roll** - The Navigator leads the party forward, marking progress boxes.
3. **Afternoon: Encounter roll** - Roll on the encounter table for the current terrain.
4. **Evening: Resource management** - Consume rations, make camp, and handle any ongoing effects.
5. **Night: Rest and recovery** - The Scout finds shelter, the party rests, and guards watch through the night.

### Travel Roles

Party members take on specialized roles that affect the journey:

- **Navigator** (mandatory) - Guides the route, determines progress
- **Scout** (mandatory) - Watches for danger and finds shelter
- **Lookout** - Maintains vigilance during travel
- **Quartermaster** - Manages supplies and rations
- **Forager/Hunter/Fisher** (optional) - Gathers food to extend supplies

See the original **Travel Activities** section for role details, updated with progress track integration.

### Encounters

Daily encounter rolls introduce variety and challenge:

- **Terrain-specific encounter tables** - Different environments have different dangers and opportunities
- **Good and bad results** - Encounters range from helpful discoveries to deadly ambushes
- **Player choices influence outcomes** - Scout and Lookout roles affect encounter frequency and surprise
- **Integration with weather** - Extreme weather can be triggered by encounter results

See **Travel Encounters** for complete tables.

### Weather and Climate

Weather affects travel difficulty and resource consumption:

- **Seasonal baselines** by biome and region
- **Daily weather generation** - Roll for conditions each day or use patterns
- **Weather as passive conditions** - Ongoing effects like rain or heat that last all day
- **Weather as encounter events** - Sudden storms or blizzards triggered by encounter rolls
- **Extreme weather effects** - Severe conditions that threaten the party

See **Weather & Climate** for the complete subsystem.

### Environment Stat Blocks

Each terrain type has a stat block defining its challenges:

- **Terrain traits** - Special properties (e.g., Desert: waterless, extreme heat)
- **Pace modifiers** - How terrain affects travel speed
- **Navigation difficulty** - Target numbers for Navigator rolls
- **Encounter frequency** - Base die size for encounter rolls
- **Resource pressure** - How the environment strains supplies
- **Hazards and complications** - Environment-specific dangers
- **Clocks and threats** - Escalating dangers if the party lingers

See **Environment Stat Blocks** for all terrain types.

## Quick Reference: Daily Travel Flow

Use this quick reference at the table:

### Morning Phase
1. Choose pace: **Slow** (safer, +1 boon on travel rolls, -1 progress), **Normal** (balanced), or **Fast** (riskier, -1 boon on travel rolls, +1 progress)
2. Assign mandatory roles: **Navigator** and **Scout**
3. Assign optional roles: **Lookout**, **Quartermaster**, **Forager**, **Hunter**, or **Fisher**

### Midday Phase
4. Navigator makes **progress roll** (Spirit + Navigation or Mind + Education)
   - Success levels determine progress boxes marked
   - Terrain modifiers apply
   - Mark boxes on progress track

### Afternoon Phase
5. Roll **encounter die** (size based on terrain and Scout results)
   - Consult terrain encounter table
   - Resolve encounter based on result
   - Scout and Lookout can influence surprise and detection

### Evening Phase
6. **Consume rations** (1 unit per person, or 2 in hot climates)
7. **Make camp** - Scout finds shelter
8. **Resolve ongoing effects** - Weather, conditions, injuries

### Night Phase
9. **Rest** - Party recovers fatigue (if shelter is adequate)
10. **Watch rotation** - Perception checks to avoid night encounters
11. **Prepare for next day** - Check supplies, plan route

## Integration with Other Systems

The travel system connects with existing game mechanics:

**Skills** - Navigation (Spirit + Nature or Mind + Education), Scouting (Spirit + Perception), Foraging (Mind + Nature), Hunting/Fishing (Spirit + Survival), and more.

**Attributes** - Strength and Fortitude for endurance, Spirit for navigation and awareness, Mind for planning and memory, Agility for difficult terrain.

**Resources** - Food and water rations, camping equipment, travel gear, mounts and vehicles.

**Conditions** - Fatigue from exhaustion, wounds from accidents, exposure from extreme weather, starvation from depleted supplies.

**Combat** - Random encounters can lead to combat scenes, using all normal combat rules.

**Downtime** - Reaching settlements provides opportunities for rest, resupply, and downtime activities.

## Example Journey Summary

> **The Desert Crossing**
> 
> The party must cross 120 leagues of scorching desert to reach the ancient city of Zal-Amara. They plan a 12-day journey at normal pace, following an old caravan route with two oases as waypoints.
> 
> **Route Planning**: The GM maps the route through three segments: (1) Sandy Desert (4 days), (2) Rocky Badlands (3 days), (3) Sand Dunes (5 days). Each segment has different challenges.
> 
> **Progress Track**: The journey needs 12 progress boxes filled. The Navigator will roll daily to mark progress, modified by desert terrain penalties.
> 
> **Roles**: Arash serves as Navigator (Spirit + Nature), Mira as Scout (Spirit + Perception), and Zara as Quartermaster. They stock extra water for the desert heat.
> 
> **Daily Procedure**: Each day, they roll progress, check for encounters (starting with d6 encounter die, modified by Scout results), consume double rations for water, and rest under what shelter Mira can find.
> 
> **Challenges**: Sandstorms, water shortages, bandits at the oases, scorching heat, and the threat of getting lost all make this journey memorable.
> 
> **Outcome**: After 13 days (one day of being lost), they arrive exhausted but alive, having faced two sandstorms, discovered ancient ruins, fought off desert raiders, and nearly ran out of water before reaching the second oasis.
