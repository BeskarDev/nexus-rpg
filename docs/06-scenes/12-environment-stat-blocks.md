# üèîÔ∏è Environment Stat Blocks

Environments in Nexus RPG have mechanical identities similar to creatures, with defined challenges, hazards, and tactical considerations. Each environment presents unique obstacles that test different party capabilities and require specific preparation.

## Understanding Environment Stat Blocks

Each environment stat block includes:

**Name** - The environment type
**Traits** - Special properties defining the environment's nature
**Navigation TN** - Target number for Navigator progress rolls
**Pace Modifiers** - How terrain affects travel speed and progress
**Encounter Die** - Base die size for daily encounters
**Resource Pressure** - How the environment strains party resources
**Hazards** - Specific environmental dangers
**Climate** - Typical weather and temperature conditions
**Clocks & Threats** - Escalating dangers if the party lingers too long

## Core Environment Stat Blocks

### Road or Trail

*Well-maintained paths and established routes through civilized or well-traveled lands.*

**Traits:** Safe, Fast Travel, Well-Marked
**Navigation TN:** 6 (Easy)
**Pace:** 
- Slow: 8 leagues/day
- Normal: 10 leagues/day
- Fast: 12 leagues/day

**Encounter Die:** d8 (Rare encounters, mostly travelers)
**Resource Pressure:** Low - Settlements and waystations along route
**Climate:** Varies by region

**Hazards:**
- Bandits at ambush points (Tier 2-4)
- Toll collectors (legitimate or criminal)
- Blocked roads (fallen trees, wash-outs)
- Territorial disputes or patrols

**Clocks & Threats:**
- None - Roads are generally stable

**GM Notes:** Roads are the safest, fastest travel. Use them for low-tension journeys or as relief between dangerous segments. Encounters should be social (merchants, pilgrims, patrols) more often than combat.

---

### Plains & Grasslands

*Wide open spaces with rolling hills, tall grasses, and few obstacles.*

**Traits:** Open, Visible From Afar, Few Natural Shelters
**Navigation TN:** 6 (Easy - can see destination from miles away)
**Pace:**
- Slow: 7 leagues/day
- Normal: 9 leagues/day
- Fast: 11 leagues/day

**Encounter Die:** d8 (Occasional - visible from distance allows avoidance)
**Resource Pressure:** Moderate - Water sources scattered, game available
**Climate:** Variable - Hot summers, cold winters, frequent wind

**Hazards:**
- Grass fires (especially in dry season)
- Sudden storms with no shelter
- Large predators (lions, wild horses, dire wolves)
- Hostile nomad tribes

**Clocks & Threats:**
- "Wildfire Clock" (4 segments): If fire starts (encounter or accident), spreads quickly
  - Segment 1: Small fire, easily avoided
  - Segment 2: Growing fire, 1d6 damage if caught in smoke
  - Segment 3: Wildfire, flee or take 2d6 fire damage
  - Segment 4: Inferno, entire region burning (turn back or die)

**GM Notes:** Plains offer fast travel but exposure. Lack of cover makes stealth impossible but also means threats are visible. Weather can turn deadly without shelter.

---

### Forest

*Dense woodlands with thick canopy, winding paths, and abundant wildlife.*

**Traits:** Obscured Vision, Abundant Resources, Easy to Get Lost
**Navigation TN:** 8 (Moderate - winding paths, thick undergrowth)
**Pace:**
- Slow: 5 leagues/day
- Normal: 6 leagues/day
- Fast: 7 leagues/day

**Encounter Die:** d6 (Common - many creatures, hidden dangers)
**Resource Pressure:** Low - Abundant foraging, hunting, water
**Climate:** Temperate - Cooler under canopy, frequent rain

**Hazards:**
- Predators (bears, wolves, wild boar)
- Poisonous plants and insects
- Hidden pits and traps (hunters or bandits)

**GM Notes:** Forests provide abundant resources but obscured visibility makes navigation hard. Excellent for Hunter/Forager roles. Rich in discovery opportunities (ruins, hermits, sacred groves).

---

### Hills & Foothills

*Rolling elevation changes, rocky outcrops, and moderate climbing.*

**Traits:** Moderate Elevation, Rocky, Vantage Points
**Navigation TN:** 8 (Moderate - ups and downs obscure true distance)
**Pace:**

**Clocks & Threats:**
- "Storm Brewing" (4 segments): Weather worsens
  - Segment 1: Dark clouds gather
  - Segment 2: Strong winds, light rain
  - Segment 3: Thunderstorm (shelter required)
  - Segment 4: Severe storm, flash floods possible

**GM Notes:** Hills are transition zones between lowlands and mountains. Good for creating varied encounters (caves, vantage points for spotting, ambush sites). Weather can change quickly.

---

  - Segment 3: Sandstorm arrives (0 progress, find shelter)
  - Segment 4: Massive storm (multiple days, survival challenge)

**GM Notes:** Deserts test resource management above all. Water is life. Make oases critical waypoints. Sandstorms should be terrifying. Night travel is cooler but navigation is harder. Emphasize the harsh beauty and deadly indifference of the desert.

**GM Notes:** Haunted lands should be oppressive and draining. Everything feels wrong. Use psychological horror alongside physical threats. Make players want to leave as quickly as possible. Excellent for story climaxes.

## Using Environment Stat Blocks

### Combining Environments

Long journeys often cross multiple terrain types:

**Transition Zones:**
- Forest ‚Üí Hills ‚Üí Mountains (gradual difficulty increase)
- Plains ‚Üí Badlands ‚Üí Desert (resource pressure increases)
- Swamp ‚Üí Jungle ‚Üí Swamp (claustrophobic throughout)

**Mixed Terrain Days:**
Some days might cross terrain boundaries:
- Use the harder terrain's TN
- Average the pace rates
- Roll on both encounter tables (or choose appropriate)

### Environment as Character

Treat each environment as an active participant in the story:

**The Desert wants:** To drain your water and leave you sun-bleached bones
**The Mountain wants:** To bury you in snow and ice
**The Swamp wants:** To infect you and trap you in its embrace
**The Jungle wants:** To consume you with its teeming life

Make environments feel alive and hostile (or benevolent for rare fortuitous environments).

### Seasonal Variations

Modify environment stats by season:

**Forest in Spring:** Lower TN (8‚Üí6), more foraging (+1 boon)
**Desert in Summer:** Higher heat pressure (3√ó water), more severe storms
**Mountains in Winter:** Much higher TN (12‚Üí14), passes may be impassable
**Plains in Autumn:** Harvest season, easier resupply at settlements
