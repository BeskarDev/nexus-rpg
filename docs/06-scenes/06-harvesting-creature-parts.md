# ðŸ”ª Harvesting Creature Parts

![banner-img](/img/banner/crafting-banner.png)

Choose from different categories:

- **Trophy.** Proof of your kill. Can be sold for an amount of coins depending on the creatureâ€™s level.
- **Tool.** Something such as poison, acid, or some other natural resource that can be directly used. The Quality increases with the creatureâ€™s level.
- **Material.** Some part of the creature that can be used in the creation of a weapon, piece of armor, or other kind of gear. The Quality increases with the creatureâ€™s level.

Process:

- Roll Crafting/Survival + Agility vs. 6 + the creatureâ€™s level
- On a success, you can harvest an amount of food from the creature, depending on itâ€™s Size. Choose between Trophy, Tool, or Gear (you canâ€™t choose the same option twice):
    - **Weak.** One of the above.
    - **Strong.** Two of the above.
    - **Critical.** All three options.
- You harvest raw food from the creature that can be used the same day instead of a ration. You gain more units from a larger creature (1 daily amount from a small creature, doubling for each Size larger â†’ 2 or medium, 4 for large, 8 for huge, â€¦). A skilled cook can also turn this food into travel rations.
- After that, the creature canâ€™t be harvested again

Scaling with creature level:

| Creature Level | Trophy Value | Tool or Material Quality |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2d6 coins | 1 |
| 2 | 2d6 x 5 coins | 2 |
| 3 | 2d6 x 10 coins | 3 |
| 4 | 2d6 x 20 coins | 4 |
| 5 | 2d6 x 50 coins | 5 |
| 6 | 2d6 x 100 coins | 5 |
| 7 | 2d6 x 200 coins | 6 |
| 8 | 2d6 x 500 coins | 6 |
| 9 | 2d6 x 1,000 coins | 7 |
| 10 | 2d6 x 2,000 coins | 7 |
