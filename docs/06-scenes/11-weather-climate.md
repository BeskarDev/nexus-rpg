# 🌦️ Weather & Climate

Weather and climate add another layer of challenge and immersion to overland travel. Harsh weather can slow progress, drain resources, cause damage, and force difficult decisions. The weather system provides both passive ongoing conditions and dramatic weather events.

## Climate Zones and Seasonal Baselines

Each region has a **climate zone** that determines its typical weather patterns:

### Climate Zones

**Temperate** (Moderate seasons)
- Spring: Mild, occasional rain
- Summer: Warm, clear skies
- Autumn: Cool, frequent rain
- Winter: Cold, snow possible

**Arid** (Hot and dry)
- Dry Season: Scorching heat, clear skies
- Wet Season: Brief intense storms

**Tropical** (Hot and humid)
- Dry Season: Hot, humid, clear
- Monsoon Season: Heavy rain, storms

**Polar** (Freezing)
- Summer: Cold, brief thaw
- Winter: Extreme cold, blizzards

**Mediterranean** (Mild)
- Wet Season: Mild, rainy
- Dry Season: Warm, dry

**Alpine** (Mountain climate)
- Variable by altitude
- Extreme weather changes

## Daily Weather Generation

The GM can generate weather in two ways:

### Method 1: Narrative Weather

Simply describe weather that fits the season and region:

> "It's early autumn in the temperate forest. Light rain falls most days, making the trails muddy. Expect cool temperatures and grey skies."

**Use this when:**
- Weather is atmospheric but not mechanically important
- You want to maintain narrative flow
- The journey is short or routine

### Method 2: Random Weather

Roll for daily weather conditions:

**Weather Die:** Roll 1d12 each morning

| Roll | Condition | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Perfect | Ideal travel conditions |
| 2-4 | Clear | Normal conditions |
| 5-7 | Overcast | Cloudy, slightly gloomy |
| 8-9 | Light Rain/Snow | Minor precipitation |
| 10-11 | Heavy Rain/Snow | Significant precipitation |
| 12 | Severe | Storms, blizzards, or extreme conditions |

**Seasonal Modifiers:**

Add modifiers based on current season in the climate zone:

**Temperate Zone:**
- Spring: +1 to weather roll (wetter)
- Summer: -1 to weather roll (drier)
- Autumn: +2 to weather roll (much wetter)
- Winter: +2 to weather roll (snow/cold)

**Arid Zone:**
- Dry Season: -3 to weather roll (almost always clear)
- Wet Season: +4 to weather roll (sudden storms)

**Tropical Zone:**
- Dry Season: No modifier
- Monsoon: +5 to weather roll (constant heavy rain)

**Polar Zone:**
- Summer: No modifier (still cold)
- Winter: +4 to weather roll (severe cold and storms)

### Weather Persistence

Weather doesn't change every day. When you roll weather:

**Clear or Perfect Weather:** Lasts 1d6 days
**Overcast:** Lasts 1d4 days
**Light Rain/Snow:** Lasts 1d3 days
**Heavy Rain/Snow:** Lasts 1d4 days
**Severe:** Lasts 1d3 days

Mark the weather duration and only roll again when it ends.

## Weather Effects on Travel

Weather conditions affect travel in multiple ways:

### Perfect Conditions

**Effects:**
- Navigator gets +1 boon on progress rolls
- Party morale is high (easier to recover fatigue)
- Excellent visibility

**When it occurs:** Rare, mostly in summer

### Clear Conditions

**Effects:**
- No modifiers
- Standard travel

**When it occurs:** Common in dry seasons

### Overcast Conditions

**Effects:**
- No mechanical penalties
- Gloomy atmosphere
- Navigation by sun/stars is harder (Navigator -1 boon if relying on celestial navigation)

**When it occurs:** Very common

### Light Rain or Snow

**Effects:**
- Terrain becomes slippery (Athletics checks -1 bane for difficult terrain)
- Visibility reduced slightly
- Light discomfort (morale effect only)
- Tracks easier to follow (+1 boon on tracking)
- Campfires harder to start (Survival -1 bane)

**When it occurs:** Common in wet seasons

### Heavy Rain or Snow

**Effects:**
- Navigator -1 bane on progress rolls (poor visibility)
- All Perception checks -1 bane (reduced visibility and noise)
- Difficult terrain becomes treacherous (Athletics checks -2 banes)
- Risk of getting lost increases
- Camping is miserable (Scout -1 bane finding shelter)
- Heavy snow: Maximum 1 progress box per day in mountains

**When it occurs:** Occasional

**Additional Effects:**
- Fires require waterproofing or shelter
- Equipment gets wet (may damage some items)
- Morale suffers (party complains)

### Severe Weather

**Effects:**
- **No progress** - Party must seek shelter immediately
- Navigator can't roll progress (0 boxes)
- Everyone exposed makes **Spirit + Fortitude TN 12** or takes **2d6 damage** (appropriate type: cold, lightning, etc.)
- Scout must find shelter: **Spirit + Survival TN 12**
  - Success: Adequate shelter, party takes no damage
  - Failure: Poor shelter, party takes half damage (1d6)
  - Blunder: No shelter, party takes full damage and gains 1 fatigue each

**Types of Severe Weather:**
- **Blizzard** (Polar/Mountain): Cold damage, potential frostbite, zero visibility
- **Sandstorm** (Desert): Abrasion damage, equipment damage, disorientation
- **Hurricane** (Tropical/Coastal): Wind and rain damage, flooding, debris
- **Thunderstorm** (Any): Lightning damage risk, flooding, panic
- **Heat Wave** (Desert/Arid): Heat exhaustion, double water consumption, fatigue

**When it occurs:** Rare but memorable

**Duration:**
- Most severe weather: 1d3 days
- Truly catastrophic: 1d6 days

## Temperature Effects

Temperature creates passive pressure on resources:

### Heat

**Moderate Heat** (Desert day, summer plains)
- **Double water consumption** - Each person needs 2 water rations per day instead of 1
- Exertion is exhausting (party -1 boon on fatigue rolls)

**Extreme Heat** (Desert midday, volcanic areas)
- **Triple water consumption**
- Everyone makes **Spirit + Fortitude TN 10** each day or gains **1 fatigue** (heat exhaustion)
- Must rest during hottest part of day (reduce progress by -1 box or suffer +1 bane on fatigue roll)

**Protective Measures:**
- Desert robes/clothing: Reduce heat effects by one step
- Travel at night/dawn/dusk: Avoid extreme heat, but navigation harder
- Shade/shelter during midday: Avoid fatigue roll but reduce progress

### Cold

**Moderate Cold** (Winter temperate, autumn mountains)
- Need warm clothing or suffer -1 bane on all rolls
- Consume 1.5× normal rations (need extra calories)
- Wet clothing becomes dangerous (see exposure)

**Extreme Cold** (Winter mountains, polar regions, blizzards)
- Everyone makes **Spirit + Fortitude TN 10** each day or gains **1 fatigue** (hypothermia)
- Need winter gear (fur cloaks, insulated boots) or suffer -2 banes on all rolls
- Exposed skin risks frostbite (permanent injury on failed saves)
- Consume 2× normal rations

**Protective Measures:**
- Warm clothing: Negates moderate cold
- Winter gear: Reduces extreme cold to moderate
- Campfires: Required for rest in cold climates
- Shelter: Essential in extreme cold

## Exposure and Environmental Damage

When protective measures fail, characters suffer **exposure**:

### Exposure Condition

**Exposure** represents dangerous environmental effects (cold, heat, wet):

**Gaining Exposure:**
- Failed weather saves (Spirit + Fortitude)
- Inadequate shelter in severe weather
- Wet clothing in cold weather
- No shade in extreme heat

**Effects of Exposure:**
- Suffer -1 bane on all rolls per level of exposure
- Each night with exposure, make **Spirit + Fortitude TN 10** or gain **1 fatigue**
- At 3+ exposure levels, start taking **1 wound per day**

**Removing Exposure:**
- Reach shelter and dry off/warm up/cool down
- Spend full day recovering in safe environment
- Magic healing (may remove exposure as a condition)

**Example:**
> Kael fails his Spirit + Fortitude save during a blizzard. He gains **exposure 1**. That night, despite finding poor shelter, he gains **exposure 2** (failed another save). He now has -2 banes on all rolls and risks gaining fatigue. The party must find better shelter or he'll continue deteriorating.

## Weather as Encounter Events

Instead of passive daily weather, some weather events are triggered by **encounter rolls**:

### Weather Events on Encounter Table

When the encounter die shows certain results, the GM can introduce a weather event instead of (or in addition to) a creature encounter:

**Challenging Result (4-6):** Minor weather event
- Sudden rain shower (lasts 1d4 hours)
- Dust devil or whirlwind (harmless but dramatic)
- Fog bank (navigation -1 bane for rest of day)
- Temperature spike or drop (adjust clothing/gear)

**Perilous Result (7-9):** Serious weather event
- Thunderstorm (1d3 hours, find shelter or take 1d6 lightning damage risk)
- Flash flood (Agility + Athletics TN 12 or swept away)
- Sudden snowstorm (0 progress for rest of day)
- Sandstorm (Spirit + Survival TN 10 to find shelter or 2d6 damage)

**Dire Result (10-11):** Severe weather event
- Blizzard (lasts 1d3 days, see severe weather rules)
- Hurricane-force winds (structural damage, flying debris, 2d6 damage per hour exposed)
- Wildfire (must flee, Agility + Athletics TN 14 to outrun, 3d6 fire damage if caught)
- Extreme heat wave (lasts 1d4 days, triple water consumption)

**Catastrophic Result (12):** Legendary weather event
- Tornado or hurricane (massive destruction, survival challenge)
- Volcanic eruption (regional devastation)
- Supernatural storm (magical effects, reality-warping)
- Climate cataclysm (the environment itself turns hostile)

**When to Use:**
- Weather-prone regions (desert, mountains, sea)
- Dramatically appropriate moments
- When you want environmental challenge instead of combat

## Seasonal Travel Challenges

Different seasons create different challenges:

### Spring

**Temperate Zones:**
- **Mud season:** Progress -1 box in forests and plains (muddy trails)
- **Flooding rivers:** May block routes, require detours
- **Renewed life:** Foraging and hunting easier (+1 boon)

**Mountains:**
- **Snowmelt:** Avalanche risk increases
- **Swollen rivers:** Dangerous crossings

### Summer

**Temperate Zones:**
- **Best travel season:** Clear weather, long days
- **Heat in plains/desert:** Water consumption doubles

**Desert:**
- **Extreme heat:** Triple water consumption, travel at night recommended

### Autumn

**Temperate Zones:**
- **Rainy season:** Frequent rain, muddy trails
- **Early snow in mountains:** Passes may close
- **Harvest time:** Villages have plenty of food (easy resupply)

**Mountains:**
- **Window closing:** Soon impassable

### Winter

**Temperate Zones:**
- **Cold and snow:** Need warm clothing
- **Short days:** Less travel time per day (-1 progress box)
- **Frozen rivers:** Can cross without bridges

**Mountains:**
- **Impassable:** Most mountain passes closed
- **Extreme danger:** Blizzards, avalanches, deadly cold

## GM Guidance: Using Weather Effectively

**Weather as Atmosphere:**
- Describe weather to set mood and tone
- Clear skies for optimistic journeys
- Storms for dramatic moments
- Use weather to mirror narrative themes

**Weather as Challenge:**
- Introduce severe weather at key moments
- Force difficult decisions (push through or shelter?)
- Create resource pressure (extra water, supplies)
- Test party preparation

**Weather as Encounter:**
- Replace combat encounters with weather events
- Vary encounters (not all fights)
- Weather + combat = extra challenge
- Extreme weather can be as deadly as monsters

**Pacing Weather:**
- Don't make every day severe weather (exhausting)
- Use 3-5 days of mild weather between major weather events
- Build to severe weather (worsening conditions)
- Reward preparation and smart choices

**Regional Weather Identity:**
- Each region should have weather "personality"
- Desert: Heat and sandstorms
- Mountains: Cold and blizzards
- Jungle: Rain and humidity
- Swamp: Fog and wet
- Make weather memorable and region-specific
