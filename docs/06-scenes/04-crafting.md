## Resolving Crafting Rolls

When you choose to craft one or more items during downtime, you need to roll the appropriate Attribute + Crafting at the end of the required time for each item.

The difficulty of an items crafting roll is determined by it’s Quality.

| Item Quality | Quality 1 | Quality 2 | Quality 3 | Quality 4 | Quality 5 | Quality 6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Crafting Difficulty | Easy (6) | Moderate (8) | Hard (10) | Very Hard (12) | Extremely Hard (14) | Nearly Impossible (16) |

Depending on how you roll, your crafting attempt will have different outcomes.

**Critical Success.** Choose one:

- You create the item for 1/4 it’s cost and in the normal amount of time.
- You create the item for 1/2 it’s cost and in 1/2 x the normal amount of time.

**Success.** You create the item for 1/2 it’s cost and in the normal amount of time.

**Failure.** Choose one:

- You create the item for 3/4 it’s cost and in the normal amount of time.
- You create the item for 1/2 it’s cost and in 2 x the normal amount of time.

**Blunder.** You create the item for 3/4 it’s cost and in 2 x the normal amount of time.

> For calculating an increase or decrease in time required to craft an item, treat the item’s cost as twice or half as high. Then compare that value to how much cost you can cover per week.

If you would have to interrupt your crafting, because you don’t have enough coins to pay for the process or it took longer than anticipated, you can interrupt your work and continue later on. When doing so, you don’t roll Crafting again, but must fulfil the original roll’s outcome. Until then, the item is unusable for it’s intended purpose.
