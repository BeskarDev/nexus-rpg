# ðŸ”¨ Crafting Professions

![banner-img](/img/banner/crafting-banner.png)

You can learn different crafting professions which expand your characterâ€˜s toolkit beyond just their skills. Professions can be used to craft items, or earn an income.

## Learning Professions

When you first learn the Crafting skill, choose one profession from the table below.

You can learn further professions during downtime the same way as additional skills.

> Each profession lists itâ€˜s usual skill test which you use to roll for that profession. However, in some situations you may roll the test with a different Attribute and/or skill, given the situation. For instance, whenever you want to recall knowledge about your profession, roll Mind + Crafting.

## Professions during Adventures

While professions are mainly useful during your downtime, you can also make use of them during your adventures. Whenever you have to roll for a test in which you have to perform an activity which can be assisted by one of your professions, you may gain +1 boon on the roll. Describe the way you utilize your profession for the roll to your GM. Then the GM decides if your profession is applicable to the given situation. You canâ€˜t benefit from multiple professions for a single roll.
