# 🧭 Travel

![banner-img](/img/banner/scenes-banner.png)

Travel covers multi-day overland journeys between known locations. It is a specialized application of the [Challenge rules](./07-challenges.md), built for situations where the party must navigate dangerous terrain, manage supplies, and deal with the unpredictable hazards of the road.

This page adds the travel-specific layer on top: **roles**, **daily procedures**, **checkpoints**, and **travel events**.

## Travel Procedure

Use these checklists at the table. Full rules for each step follow below.

**Travel Setup (GM, before play)**

1. Define the route
2. Choose challenge dice and travel difficulty
3. Set checkpoints

**Daily Travel Procedure (each travel day)**

1. Assign roles
2. Declare travel modifiers *(optional)*
3. Roll for Navigator
4. Check for arrival or checkpoints
5. Roll for Scout
6. Roll daily event
7. Roll for optional Roles
8. Make camp

## Travel Setup

### 1. Define the Route

Set origin, destination, terrain types along the way.

**Preparation by the GM**

Default option where the GM decides on what route the players have to take to reach their destination. They might plan for multiple branching routes in parts and allow the players to make an informed decision during the game about which route to take (danger vs. length).

**Collaboration at the table**

If you use a map for your game, you can also plot the course of the journey collaboratively between the GM and the players directly at the gaming table.

### 2. Choose Challenge Dice and Difficulty

The travel system uses the same concept of **Challenge Dice** as introduced in the [Challenges](./07-challenges.md) section as well as a universal travel difficulty for any rolls during the journey.

**Challenge Dice**

Choose a challenge die representing the length of the journey. For very long journeys, use multiple consecutive challenge dice for individual segments of the journey (split by terrain type for example).

With an average of 2 progress per day, each challenge die takes roughly **half its maximum value in days** to complete. Good rolls shorten the journey; bad terrain and failed rolls extend it.

| **Challenge Die** | **Avg. Days** |
| --- | --- |
| d4 | 2 |
| d6 | 3 |
| d8 | 4 |
| d10 | 5 |
| d12 | 6 |

> When traveling multiple weeks, either use multiple larger challenge dice or consider abstracting this travel procedure further to a weekly routine instead of a daily routine. This depends on how complex and eventful the journey is supposed to be, of course. Don't do this for epic journeys along a treacherous and eventful route, which can be exciting adventures all by themselves!

**Travel Difficulty**

Along each challenge die, choose an appropriate TN as the Difficulty for navigating, scouting, and looking for supplies along the journey. This may depend on terrain type or other environmental factors (natural or magical).

| Difficulty (TN) | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Medium (8) | Road, plains, grassland, calm river |
| Hard (10) | Forest, swamp, marshland, hills, foothills, rocky desert, tundra, ice fields, coastal sea |
| Very Hard (12) | Mountains, wasteland, sandy desert, jungle |
| Extreme (14) | Haunted or cursed lands |

> The travel difficulty treats all rolls made during the journey the same for simplicity. There may be other factors for any specific terrain type that influence only the rolls of singular tasks. For example, trying to find food and water in a desert might be much harder or even impossible outright. Depending on the GM's judgement, such rolls may gain boons, suffer banes, or are impossible.

### 3. Set Checkpoints

After plotting out the entire journey, the GM should set checkpoints along the route to denote settlements, landmarks, camping spots, and danger zones. Some of these checkpoints may be public knowledge available to the adventurers or they are hidden and only reveal themselves once the group reaches them.

Assign your checkpoints to certain values along your challenge die when they will occur. For long journeys, you can instead assign your checkpoints to the completion of individual challenge dice.

| Checkpoint Type | Examples | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Safepoint | Inn, farmstead, friendly settlement | Provides food, drink, and a place to sleep against payment. |
| Landmark | Ancient monument, mountain pass, river crossing | Navigation aid. The Navigator gains +1 boon on their next Navigation roll. One party member may remove 1 Fatigue. |
| Camp | Natural shelter, cave, oasis, clear stream | Good shelter for the night (auto-succeed on shelter). Forager, Hunter, and Fisher gain +1 boon on their rolls the following day. |
| Blockade | Military blockade, monster nest, collapsed bridge | Blocks the intended route. May need convincing, bribing, fighting, or choosing to make a detour (increase the challenge die by 1). |
| Extreme Climate | Extreme heat, extreme cold, magical storm | Environmental hazard requiring a Strength + Fortitude roll vs. the travel difficulty or suffer 1 Fatigue. May occur in addition to the normal daily procedure. In extreme heat, each party member must also roll an additional Supply Check for their rations (representing increased water consumption). |
| Ambush | Bandits, hungry monsters, hostile patrol | The group is ambushed by a hostile group. The group rolls for "Getting Surprised". If the Scout chose "avoid danger" during their last Scout roll, everyone in the group gets +1 boon on this roll. |

> Checkpoints should be used sparingly and feel more scripted or significant than random daily events. Environmental checkpoints like "Extreme Climate" may appear more often (once a day or so) to represent very hostile environments, while narrative checkpoints like "Blockade" or "Ambush" should mark turning points in the journey.
>
> When a checkpoint is reached, the scene switches immediately towards it, even if the Navigator's roll resulted in further progress beyond the checkpoint's position. Any remaining progress is applied after the checkpoint scene is resolved or the players decide to stay at the checkpoint for the rest of the day (e.g. arriving at an inn early and choosing to spend the night there).

## Daily Travel Procedure

### 1. Assign Roles

During travel, adventurers have to fill multiple roles for successful navigation, avoiding danger, and managing supplies. At the start of any day of travel, adventurers pick which role they want to fill. Two mandatory roles must be assigned, the remaining adventurers may take optional roles.

**Mandatory Roles**

- Navigator (determines how much progress the group makes each day)
- Scout (surveys the surroundings, finds safe camps, and provides early warning of events ahead)

**Optional Roles**

- Quartermaster (manages supplies, ensures gear is maintained, and optimizes ration use)
- Forager (searches for edible plants, clean water, and useful materials along the route)
- Hunter (tracks and kills game to supplement or replace rations)
- Fisher (catches fish from rivers, lakes, or coastal waters)

> **Multi-role rule:** An adventurer filling more than one role suffers +1 bane per additional role on all role rolls that day.
>
> **Shared role rule:** If two or more characters share the same optional role, the primary roller gains +1 boon.

### 2. Declare Travel Modifiers

Through different sources the speed of the group's progress may be modified. Check which ones apply each day and use the modifier for the result of the Navigator's roll. Modifiers can never cancel out progress of successful navigation rolls completely (min. 1 progress).

**Forced March**

The group may choose to increase their distance covered by skipping breaks and shortening their rest time. They gain +1 progress but all suffer 1 Fatigue. This also disables access to the Forager, Hunter, and Fisher roles for the day.

**Mounts or Vehicles**

If all members of the group ride a mount or vehicle, their travel progress is increased. This may not be possible in difficult terrain types.

| Mount or Vehicle | Modifier |
| --- | --- |
| Draft horse | +0 progress (but can draw vehicles and carry load) |
| Riding horse or row boat | +1 progress |
| War horse or sailing boat | +2 progress |
| Large ship | +3 progress or more (depending on ship type) |

**Encumbrance**

If at least one member of the group exceeds their Carry Capacity and is encumbered, the group suffers -1 progress.

**Terrain**

Different terrain types affect the speed of progress as well.

| Terrain Type | Modifier |
| --- | --- |
| Road | +1 progress |
| Plains or grasslands | +0 progress |
| Forest, jungle, hills, mountains, swamps or marshes | -1 progress |

### 3. Roll for Navigator

The Navigator rolls Spirit/Mind + Nature vs. the travel difficulty.

Depending on their SL they make a certain amount of progress, including the travel modifiers (more details at the Navigator role below). Reduce the challenge die by the amount of progress made.

### 4. Check for Arrival or Checkpoints

If the challenge die reached 0, the group arrives at their destination. If they only passed a single segment of a longer journey, replace the challenge die with the one for the next segment and set it to its max. value.

When a checkpoint is reached (previously recorded value on the challenge die), the scene switches immediately towards it, even if the Navigator's roll resulted in further progress. Any further progress on the challenge die is resolved after the scene for the checkpoint is over or the players decide to stay at the location of the checkpoint for the rest of the day (e.g. arriving at an inn early and choosing to spend the night there).

### 5. Roll for Scout

The Scout rolls Spirit + Perception/Survival vs. the travel difficulty. Depending on the SL, they have the choice between different positive or negative outcomes for the day.

If they choose "make a discovery", roll on the Discovery Event Table below, then roll on the corresponding sub-table to determine the specifics.

### 6. Roll Daily Event

The GM rolls 1d6 on the Travel Event Table and resolves the effect. If the Scout chose an outcome for the daily event, one of the following happens instead:

- "avoid danger": The GM rolls twice on the Travel Event Table and announces the general category of both results. The Scout can choose one of the two results, the other one is discarded.
- "surprised": The GM rolls twice on the Travel Event Table, choosing in which order both events occur during the day.

> The influence of the Scout is a representation for how they might perceive dangers from far ahead, prompting the Navigator to take another route, or lead the group directly towards something.

The GM can either choose or randomly determine the time of day when the event occurs.

| 1d6 | Time of day |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Morning |
| 2 | Noon |
| 3 | Afternoon |
| 4 | Evening |
| 5-6 | Night |

**Travel Event Table**

| 1d6 | Category | What Happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Encounter** | You cross paths with creatures, travelers, or a hostile force. Roll on a region-appropriate encounter table. |
| 2 | **Wear and Tear** | Long days on the road strain gear. Each adventurer chooses one item they possess. If it tracks Durability, make a Durability check. Otherwise, it loses 1 use. |
| 3 | **Rations Run Low** | Food runs low, water sources dry up, or stored rations spoil. Each party member must roll a Supply Check for their rations. |
| 4 | **Route Shift** | Conditions change along the route. Roll 1d6: (1-2) Weather turns harsh, the Navigator suffers +1 bane on the next Navigation roll. (3-4) Road or bridge blocked, the challenge die increases by 1. (5-6) Terrain harder than expected, the group suffers -1 progress tomorrow. |
| 5 | **Traces** | Signs of other travelers, old markers, animal migrations, or distant smoke hint at what lies ahead. The GM shares one useful detail about the route ahead — nearby water sources, potential dangers, or the presence of other travelers. |
| 6 | **Ambient** | A striking sunset, a cool breeze, or a peaceful night. Atmosphere and flavor, but nothing of mechanical note occurs. |

**Discovery Event Table**

When a Scout makes a discovery, roll 1d6 on the table below, then roll on the corresponding sub-table to determine the specifics.

| 1d6 | Discovery | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Hidden Treasure** | Something valuable is spotted, but claiming it carries a risk or cost. Roll on the Hidden Treasure sub-table. |
| 2 | **Awe-Inspiring Vista** | A breathtaking sight fills the party with renewed determination. Each party member regains 1 Resolve (up to their maximum). Roll on the Vista sub-table for the specific sight. |
| 3 | **Hidden Shortcut** | A concealed path cuts through the terrain. The Navigator gains +1 boon on their next Navigation roll. Roll on the Shortcut sub-table for the specific path. |
| 4 | **Suspicious Shelter** | A potentially useful shelter along the route with a small bonus. Roll on the Suspicious Shelter sub-table. |
| 5 | **Warning Signs** | Evidence of what lies ahead. The GM pre-rolls the next day's Travel Event and reveals the result to the party. The group can choose to prepare for the event (each party member gains +1 boon on any rolls to deal with it) or take a detour to avoid it (the event does not occur, but the group suffers -1 progress as they reroute). Roll on the Warning Signs sub-table for the specific evidence. |
| 6 | **Travelers** | The Scout spots other people in the area. Roll on the Travelers sub-table. |

**Hidden Treasure (1d6)**

| 1d6 | Situation |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | A creature guards a small cache of coins or valuables near its lair. The party must drive it off or sneak past to claim the treasure. |
| 2 | An old merchant's wagon lies half-buried off the trail, still loaded with goods. Salvaging takes time — the group suffers -1 progress today if they stop to loot it. |
| 3 | A locked and trapped chest sits inside a ruin. Opening it requires a Mind + Crafting roll vs. the travel difficulty or it triggers a trap (2d6 damage to the opener). |
| 4 | Valuable ore, gemstones, or rare herbs grow in a precarious spot — a cliff face, unstable ledge, or flooded hollow. An Agility + Athletics roll vs. the travel difficulty is needed to harvest safely. On a failure, the harvester suffers 1d6 damage. |
| 5 | A dead adventurer's pack contains useful supplies, but the body shows signs of a nearby predator. Lingering to search risks an encounter. |
| 6 | A shrine holds an offering of valuables. Taking them is easy, but may invoke the wrath of local believers or a minor curse (GM's discretion). |

**Awe-Inspiring Vista (1d6)**

| 1d6 | Sight |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | A towering natural arch frames the setting sun over a vast canyon. |
| 2 | An ancient colossus, half-buried, stands silent watch over a forgotten valley. |
| 3 | A pristine mountain lake perfectly reflects the surrounding peaks. |
| 4 | A grove of enormous ancient trees, their canopy glowing with bioluminescent moss. |
| 5 | A thundering waterfall cascades into a crystal-clear basin, rainbows arcing through the mist. |
| 6 | The fossilized remains of a titanic creature, its bones turned to stone and overgrown with wildflowers. |

**Hidden Shortcut (1d6)**

| 1d6 | Path |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | An animal trail winds through otherwise impassable undergrowth. |
| 2 | A dried riverbed cuts a smooth path between steep cliffs. |
| 3 | A forgotten stone road, overgrown but still solid underfoot. |
| 4 | A natural cave tunnel passes straight through a hill or ridge. |
| 5 | An ancient bridge, hidden by ivy and moss, still spans a gorge. |
| 6 | A shepherd's path marked by barely visible cairns. |

**Suspicious Shelter (1d6)**

| 1d6 | Location |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | An old campsite with a fire pit and scattered supplies. Provides shelter tonight and the party finds 1d4 simple rations (d4). |
| 2 | An abandoned hunter's hut, partially collapsed but serviceable. Provides shelter and contains a set of basic tools (d6 supply die). |
| 3 | A mine entrance leads to a dry, sheltered cavern. Provides shelter and the party finds 1d4 units of primitive materials (d6). |
| 4 | A roadside shrine to a forgotten god. Provides shelter. One party member who prays or meditates here regains 1 Resolve (up to their maximum). |
| 5 | A merchant's waystation, long disused but still standing. Provides shelter and the party finds a small cache of forgotten trade goods worth 2d6 x 10 coins. |
| 6 | A cave behind a waterfall. Provides shelter and access to fresh water — each party member can skip their daily Supply Check for rations today. |

**Warning Signs (1d6)**

| 1d6 | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Deep claw marks gouged into tree trunks or rocks, growing fresher along the trail. |
| 2 | The remains of a recent camp, hastily abandoned — scattered gear, cold ashes, and drag marks. |
| 3 | Stone cairns arranged in a warning pattern, recognized with a Mind + Education or Lore roll. |
| 4 | Circling carrion birds in the distance marking something dead or dying ahead. |
| 5 | A crude warning sign left by previous travelers, carved into wood or scratched into stone. |
| 6 | Unusual silence — no birdsong, no insects, no animal movement in the area ahead. |

**Travelers (1d6)**

| 1d6 | Encounter |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | A traveling merchant with a small cart of wares. The party can buy or trade supplies at standard prices. |
| 2 | A patrol of soldiers or local guards. They share information about the road ahead — the GM reveals one upcoming checkpoint or danger zone. |
| 3 | A hermit or wandering sage with knowledge of the area. Offers useful local information in exchange for a meal or small favor. The Navigator gains +1 boon on their next Navigation roll. |
| 4 | A group of fellow adventurers willing to share a camp for the night (auto-succeed on shelter) and exchange rumors about the region. |
| 5 | Refugees or displaced travelers fleeing danger ahead. They warn of a specific threat — the GM reveals the next day's Travel Event result. |
| 6 | A suspicious individual or small group. Their intentions are unclear — they might offer honest trade, beg for help, or be scouting for bandits. The GM decides based on the region. |

### 7. Roll for Optional Roles

If any optional roles were picked and are possible in the current terrain, they can make their rolls in any order as described below in the Travel Roles section.

### 8. Make Camp

At the end of the day, the group needs to find shelter, consume rations, and sleep for the night. The group must meet **all** of the following conditions or else they suffer 1 Fatigue each and a bad night (described in the [Resting](./03-resting.md) section):

- The Scout finds shelter.
- Everyone consumes food and water. This includes companions and mounts.
- Everyone has a full night's rest (8 hours with no more than 2 hours of light non-physical activity in between).

Choosing to stay the night at any hospitable checkpoint like an inn or a homestead negates the need for shelter and offers food and water for coins instead of relying on rations.

Any fight or other stressful activity during the night's rest does lead to a bad night.
