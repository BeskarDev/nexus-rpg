# ðŸ§­ Route Planning

Before embarking on a journey, the party and Game Master work together to plan the route. This preparation phase establishes the journey's scope, identifies challenges, and sets expectations for travel time and resource needs.

## The Route Planning Process

Route planning follows these steps:

### Step 1: Define Origin and Destination

Clearly establish where the journey begins and where it ends. Use the campaign map to identify both locations.

**Questions to Answer:**
- Where exactly are we starting? (City, village, landmark, wilderness location)
- Where exactly are we going? (Specific destination or general region)
- Why are we making this journey? (Quest, trade, escape, exploration)
- Are there alternative routes we should consider?

**GM Considerations:**
- How familiar is the party with this region?
- Are there known routes, roads, or trails?
- What information do the characters have about the journey?

### Step 2: Map the Route

Work with the GM to trace the route on the campaign map, identifying:

**Major Terrain Segments** - Break the journey into distinct terrain types:
- "We travel 3 days through forest, then 5 days across open plains, then 2 days through hills."
- Each terrain segment has different properties (see Environment Stat Blocks)

**Waypoints** - Mark important stops along the route:
- **Settlements** - Villages, towns, or cities where you can resupply and rest safely
- **Landmarks** - Ruins, monuments, or natural features that serve as navigation markers
- **Known Camps** - Established campsites, caravanserais, or waystations
- **Water Sources** - Rivers, oases, wells, or springs critical for desert/badlands travel
- **Danger Zones** - Areas known to be especially hazardous

**Alternative Routes** - Consider multiple paths:
- **Main Route** - The most common or obvious path (usually safer but longer)
- **Shortcuts** - Faster routes that may be more dangerous or difficult
- **Scenic Route** - Longer but safer, following roads or established paths

### Step 3: Estimate Segment Lengths

For each terrain segment, estimate the distance and travel time:

**Using Map Scale:**
- Refer to the campaign map's scale (e.g., "1 hex = 6 leagues" or "1 inch = 10 leagues")
- Measure or count hexes/squares along the planned route
- Add up the total distance in leagues or miles

**Convert Distance to Travel Days:**

Base travel rate depends on **pace** and **terrain type**:

| Terrain Type | Slow Pace | Normal Pace | Fast Pace |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Road/Trail | 8 leagues/day | 10 leagues/day | 12 leagues/day |
| Plains/Grassland | 7 leagues/day | 9 leagues/day | 11 leagues/day |
| Forest/Jungle | 5 leagues/day | 6 leagues/day | 7 leagues/day |
| Hills/Foothills | 5 leagues/day | 6 leagues/day | 7 leagues/day |
| Mountains | 3 leagues/day | 4 leagues/day | 5 leagues/day |
| Desert/Badlands | 6 leagues/day | 7 leagues/day | 8 leagues/day |
| Swamp/Marsh | 4 leagues/day | 5 leagues/day | 6 leagues/day |
| Tundra/Ice | 5 leagues/day | 6 leagues/day | 7 leagues/day |

**Formula:** `Days Required = Total Distance Ã· Daily Travel Rate`

**Example:**
> The party plans to cross 42 leagues of forest. At normal pace (6 leagues/day), this requires 42 Ã· 6 = 7 days.

### Step 4: Account for Modifiers

Several factors can modify base travel rates:

**Load and Encumbrance:**
- **Lightly Loaded** (no modifier) - Carrying only essential gear
- **Heavily Loaded** (+1 day per segment) - Carrying maximum load or trade goods
- **Overloaded** (+2 days per segment) - Exceeding normal limits (requires GM permission)

**Mounts and Vehicles:**
- **Riding Horses** - Increase travel rate by +2 leagues/day on suitable terrain
- **Draft Animals with Wagon** - Reduce travel rate by -2 leagues/day but carry more supplies
- **Camels** - No penalty in desert, increase rate by +1 league/day
- **Ships/Boats** - Use separate water travel rates (see GM for details)

**Weather and Season:**
- **Favorable Weather** - No modifier (clear skies, mild temperatures)
- **Harsh Weather** (+1-2 days per segment) - Rain, snow, extreme heat/cold
- **Severe Weather** (+3-5 days per segment) - Blizzards, floods, sandstorms
- **Season** - Winter in mountains, monsoon in jungle, dry season in desert all affect travel time

**Party Size:**
- **Small Party** (2-4 people) - No modifier
- **Large Group** (5-8 people) - +1 day per long segment (7+ days)
- **Caravan** (9+ people or animals) - +2 days per segment, easier to spot

**Navigation Quality:**
- **Expert Guide** - Reduce time by -1 day per segment (minimum 1 day)
- **Lost** - Add +1d4 days to segment length
- **Excellent Maps** - Grant +1 boon on Navigator rolls
- **No Maps/Unknown Territory** - Grant -1 bane on Navigator rolls

### Step 5: Calculate Total Travel Time

Add up all segment travel times plus modifiers:

**Total Time = Î£(Segment Days) + Modifiers**

**Example Calculation:**
> **Journey:** City of Arak to Desert City of Zal-Amara
> 
> **Segments:**
> - Forest: 24 leagues at normal pace = 4 days
> - Plains: 45 leagues at normal pace = 5 days
> - Desert: 49 leagues at normal pace = 7 days
> - **Base Total: 16 days**
> 
> **Modifiers:**
> - Heavily loaded with trade goods: +3 days (one per segment)
> - Summer heat in desert: +1 day
> - **Modified Total: 20 days**

### Step 6: Plan Resources

Based on total travel time, calculate required supplies:

**Food and Water:**
- **Base Consumption:** 1 ration per person per day
- **Hot Climate:** 2 rations per person per day (doubled water needs)
- **Cold Climate:** 1.5 rations per person per day (need extra calories)

**Formula:** `Rations Needed = Party Size Ã— Days Ã— Climate Multiplier`

Add **safety margin** of +25% to +50% for unexpected delays:

**Example:**
> **4 people, 20 days, desert travel (Ã—2 for water)**
> - Base: 4 Ã— 20 Ã— 2 = 160 rations
> - Safety margin (+33%): 160 + 53 = 213 rations
> - **Plan to carry: 213 rations** (or 53 days worth for 4 people in normal climate)

**Other Supplies:**
- **Camping Kit** - 1 per party (Load 3-5)
- **Waterskins** - 2-3 per person in desert (Load 1 each when full)
- **Rope** - 50 ft coil (Load 1)
- **Lanterns/Torches** - For night travel or caves
- **Medicine** - Healing herbs, bandages, antitoxin
- **Spare Clothing** - For weather changes

**Carrying Capacity:**
Consider how much the party can actually carry:
- **Adventurer Max Load:** Typically 10-15 Load depending on Strength
- **Pack Animal:** Can carry 20-30 Load
- **Wagon:** Can carry 100+ Load but slows travel

If supplies exceed carrying capacity:
- Hire pack animals or wagons
- Cache supplies at waypoints
- Plan to forage/hunt en route (risky)
- Reduce safety margin (very risky)

### Step 7: Identify Risks and Prepare

Review the planned route for known hazards:

**Environmental Hazards:**
- Desert crossing â†’ Need extra water, heat protection, risk of sandstorms
- Mountain pass â†’ Need cold weather gear, risk of avalanches
- Swamp â†’ Need disease prevention, risk of getting lost
- Forest â†’ Need navigation aids, risk of predators

**Political/Social Hazards:**
- Bandit territory â†’ Plan alternate route or hire guards
- Hostile nation â†’ Need travel papers or disguises
- Tribal lands â†’ May need to negotiate passage
- War zone â†’ Avoid or prepare for conflict

**Timing Hazards:**
- Winter mountain pass â†’ Impassable due to snow
- Monsoon season â†’ Flooded rivers and muddy trails
- Festival/holy days â†’ Settlements may be full or restricted
- Eclipse/omen â†’ Superstitious areas may close roads

**Preparation Checklist:**
- [ ] Do we have enough supplies for expected travel time + safety margin?
- [ ] Do we have the right gear for terrain and weather?
- [ ] Do we have necessary travel papers, maps, or guides?
- [ ] Have we assigned travel roles (Navigator, Scout, etc.)?
- [ ] Do we know the waypoint locations for resupply?
- [ ] Have we planned for known hazards?
- [ ] Do we have a backup plan if the route becomes impassable?

## Route Planning Examples

## GM Guidance: Creating Routes

**Balancing Challenge and Fun:**
- **Short journeys (2-4 days):** Focus on one or two interesting encounters or challenges
- **Medium journeys (5-10 days):** Include multiple terrain types, at least one waypoint, varied encounters
- **Long journeys (11+ days):** Epic scope with multiple segments, several waypoints, resource pressure, and escalating stakes

**Unknown Territory:**
When the party ventures into uncharted lands:
- They may not know exact distances (estimate as a range)
- Terrain types may be unclear (require exploration to discover)
- Waypoints are unknown (must be found through scouting or luck)
- Navigation is harder (banes on Navigator rolls)

**Building Tension:**
- Start with easier segments to establish the journey
- Escalate difficulty in middle segments (resource pressure builds)
- Add dramatic complication before final segment (create climax)
- Reward clever planning and preparation

**Integrating Story:**
- Tie encounters to campaign narrative
- Place story-relevant discoveries at waypoints
- Use journey to introduce new NPCs or factions
- Create meaningful choices between routes (safety vs. speed, allies vs. enemies)
