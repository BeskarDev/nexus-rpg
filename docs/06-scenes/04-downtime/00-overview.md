# 🏠 Downtime

![banner-img](/img/banner/crafting-banner.png)

Whenever adventurers return from their perilous quests, they find solace in the familiar comforts of civilization. This downtime offers a chance to rest, replenish your supplies, and let you prepare for the challenges that lie ahead. You might spend your hard-earned coins on new equipment, forge alliances, or simply enjoy the peace and quiet of a well-deserved break.

Downtime is measured in weeks, where each adventurer can choose to partake in a variety of downtime activities. You choose one downtime activity per week.

When you take at least a week of downtime, it is assumed that you have time and opportunity to do the following things:

- You are able to spend any XP you gained during the last adventure on your skills. Think of a plausible way of how you utilize your skills you want to improve during downtime.
- You can buy and sell any items with a Quality equal or lower than the settlement’s advancement level. If you want to look for higher quality items, you can do so by taking the Haggle activity.
- You automatically heal one Wound per week of downtime. If you want to heal your Wounds faster, you can take the Recover activity.

## Settlements

Each type of civilized settlement falls into one of the following categories, where it‘s Settlement Rank denotes what Quality of items and infrastructure one can expect to find there (though there may be exceptions):

1. **Hamlet** (small primitive settlement or outpost with a handful of farms around it, consists of a few dozen inhabitants)
2. **Village** (decently sized settlement specialized in trade, farming, or other resources, consists of around one to two hundred inhabitants)
3. **Town** (the core settlement of a local region dependent on the produce of multiple villages to sustain itself, home of a local ruler overseeing multiple smaller settlements, consists of some hundreds of inhabitants)
4. **City** (the dominant settlement of entire realms dependent on the produce of multiple regions to sustain itself, residence of kings and queens, consists of some thousands of inhabitants)

> Note that there will always be exceptions to these Settlement Ranks. For example, a small outpost in the borderlands being frequently passed by shrewd merchants collecting rare artifacts will have a higher Settlement Rank for obtaining and selling magical items.
Anything with a Quality above 4 will also only be available in unique settlements outside of mortal realms. You might for instance have to find a village of forest spirits on the border of the mortal realm and those beyond to find high Quality enchanted items.
