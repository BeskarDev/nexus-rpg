# 📖 Travel Examples

This section provides complete worked examples of journeys using the full travel system, from route planning through daily progression to final arrival. These examples demonstrate how all the components fit together at the table.

## Example 1: The Forest Path (Short Journey)

**Scenario:** The party must deliver urgent news from the village of Thornwood to the town of Ravenholm, three days away through dense forest.

### Route Planning Phase

**Origin:** Thornwood Village (farming settlement)
**Destination:** Ravenholm (fortified town)
**Distance:** 18 leagues through forest
**Expected Time:** 3 days at normal pace (6 leagues/day)

**Terrain:** Single segment - Dense Forest
**Progress Track:** 3 boxes (1 per expected day)

```
Thornwood ◯ ◯ ◯ Ravenholm
          1 2 3
```

**Waypoints:**
- Box 2: Hunter's Cabin (known campsite, +1 boon for rest)

**Resources:**
- Party of 4 adventurers
- 3 days expected, +33% margin = 4 days supplies = 16 rations
- Camping kit, standard gear

**Roles:**
- Arash: Navigator (Spirit d10 + Nature 3)
- Mira: Scout (Spirit d8 + Perception 2)
- Kael: Lookout (Spirit d8 + Perception 3)
- Zara: (no travel role, assists with camp)

**Risks:** Known wolf pack in area, occasional bandits

### Day 1: Into the Woods

**Morning Phase:**
- Weather: Overcast, cool (light rain possible later)
- Pace: Normal (balanced approach)
- Roles assigned as planned

**Midday Phase - Progress Roll:**
- Arash (Navigator) rolls Spirit + Nature vs TN 8 (Forest)
- Roll: d10 (6) + 1d6 (4) + 3 = **13 vs TN 8**
- **Strong Success** (5 above TN)
- **Mark 2 progress boxes** (now at 2/3)
- **Choose bonus:** "On Track" (+1 boon next navigation roll)

> *Arash finds an old game trail that cuts through the densest undergrowth. The party makes excellent time, covering two days' distance in one.*

**Afternoon Phase - Encounter Roll:**
- Mira (Scout) rolls Spirit + Perception vs TN 8
- Roll: d8 (5) + 1d6 (3) + 2 = **10 vs TN 8**
- **Weak Success** (2 above TN)
- **Choose:** "Avoid Danger" (decrease encounter die by one step)
- Encounter die: d6 → d4

- Roll d4 encounter die: **2** (Neutral encounter)
- Consult Forest Encounter Table: "Abandoned woodcutter's camp with some usable supplies"

> *Mira spots smoke rising through the trees and leads the party cautiously to investigate. They find an old woodcutter's camp, abandoned recently. The fire pit still has warm coals. They scavenge 2 rations and some useful rope, then move on quickly.*

**Evening Phase:**
- Consume 4 rations (1 per person)
- Make camp in clearing near stream
- Scout found adequate shelter (no penalty)

**Night Phase:**
- Party rests (no fatigue roll needed, journey just started)
- Kael keeps watch (no incidents)

**Progress:** 2/3 boxes filled, ahead of schedule

### Day 2: The Hunter's Cabin

**Morning Phase:**
- Weather: Light rain begins
- Pace: Normal (maintaining good progress)
- Arash still has +1 boon from yesterday's "On Track" bonus

**Midday Phase - Progress Roll:**
- Arash rolls Spirit + Nature vs TN 8 with +1 boon
- Roll: d10 (4) + 2d6 (4, 2 = take 4) + 3 = **11 vs TN 8**
- **Strong Success** (3 above TN)
- **Mark 1 more box** - Journey complete! (3/3 boxes)
- But they arrive at midday, not evening

> *The party reaches the outskirts of Ravenholm by midday, the town's walls visible through the rain. Arash's excellent navigation has cut a full half-day off the expected journey.*

**Outcome:**
- Journey completed in 1.5 days instead of 3
- Used only 8 rations instead of 16 (surplus 8 rations)
- No combat encounters
- Party arrives well-rested and ready
- News delivered urgently as needed

**GM Notes:** Strong navigation rolls dramatically shortened this journey. The party's preparation exceeded the actual need, but that's better than running short. The quick journey meant they could handle the urgent quest without delay.

At the hut, they meet old shepherd who warns: "First snows have already fallen at the pass. You have perhaps 15 days before it becomes impassable. Less if a blizzard comes early."

Party realizes time pressure is real. They have 18 days remaining, need to cover 13 more boxes.

### Day 3-8: Low Mountains

## GM Guidance: Running Travel Sessions

### Session Pacing

**Hour 1: Planning and Departure**
- Route planning (10-15 minutes)
- Shopping and preparation (10-15 minutes)
- Departure scene and first day (20-30 minutes)

**Hour 2-3: Journey Progression**
- Abstract less interesting days ("Days 2-4 pass uneventfully, you make steady progress")
- Zoom in on interesting days with encounters or challenges
- One significant encounter or event per session
- Use progress track to show advancement

**Hour 4: Arrival or Cliffhanger**
- Reach waypoint or destination
- Resolve journey consequences
- Set up next story beat

### When to Abstract Travel

Skip detailed day-by-day when:
- Players are engaged in other story beats
- Journey is routine and safe
- Time pressure requires faster pacing
- Players prefer narrative focus over resource management

**How to Abstract:**
> "The next three days pass without major incident. You make steady progress, consume 12 rations, and mark 3 boxes. On the fourth day, as you approach the ruins, you notice something strange..."

### Making Travel Meaningful

**Connect to Character:**
- Downtime during travel for character development
- Travel roles showcase different skills
- Challenges that require specific character abilities

**Connect to Story:**
- Foreshadowing through encounters
- NPCs met during travel become important later
- Discoveries that advance plot
- Time pressure creates urgency

**Connect to World:**
- Travel reveals geography and culture
- Different regions feel distinct (climate, dangers, people)
- Waypoints become memorable locations
- Environments have personality

### Common Pitfalls

**Too Much Detail:** Not every day needs full resolution. Summarize routine days.

**Too Little Challenge:** Some journeys should be easy (don't wear out the system).

**Ignoring Consequences:** Wounds, fatigue, and supply depletion matter. Track them.

**Railroading:** Let player choices (pace, route, preparation) matter. Reward clever planning.

**Forgetting Fun:** Travel system serves the story, not vice versa. Skip it if it's slowing down play.

These examples demonstrate the travel system in action across different journey types and challenge levels. Adapt the detail level to fit your table's preferences and the narrative importance of each journey.
