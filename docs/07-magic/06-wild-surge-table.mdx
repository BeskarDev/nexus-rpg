# 🎲 Wild Surge Table

![banner-img](/img/banner/magic-banner.png)

When you blunder a **rank 1 or higher** arcane spell, roll 1d100 and apply the result immediately. All effects are temporary.

**Targeting:** Choose nearest valid target by distance; if tied, random. Default to caster if no valid target exists.

**Scaling:** Effects list values for spell ranks 1/2/3/4/5 where applicable.

**Random Locations:** When an effect teleports creatures to "random locations," the GM chooses valid unoccupied spaces within the specified range, distributing them evenly around the area or rolling randomly for each creature's direction and distance.

## Quick Roller

## How to adjudicate

- The player rolls the d100, but the GM reads the result and describes how it manifests. The roll determines the effect; the GM decides the concrete placement, timing, and any narrative detail necessary to resolve it fairly.
- Targeting: by default use the table's targeting guidance (nearest valid target by distance; if tied, random). If the effect covers an area, the GM chooses the centre point (or roll randomly). The GM may use one of these deterministic or random methods when multiple valid targets exist:
	- Nearest: choose the nearest valid target by distance from the caster. If multiple are tied, roll 1dX among tied targets.
	- Initiative index: select the Nth creature in initiative order (roll 1dN). This tends to bias toward currently active combatants.
	- Random distribution: roll 1d8 for direction and 1d4 for distance to place affected points (useful for scatter/teleport effects).
	- Spread evenly: when the effect teleports or scatters multiple creatures, distribute them evenly around a chosen point or roll randomly per creature if the table says so.
- Tie-breakers: always break ties randomly (roll among tied candidates) unless the GM decides otherwise for narrative reasons.
- Cascading: some entries intentionally spawn additional table rolls (for example, Wild Zone and Reality Ripple). Those specific entries explicitly say they "don't cascade" — treat them as single additional rolls only. Never allow infinite recursion; if multiple roll-triggers would cascade, resolve only one extra roll unless the table explicitly permits otherwise.
- GM improvisation: if a result calls for a "random location" or ambiguous surreal consequence, favor descriptive weirdness over strict mechanics; use short adjudication rolls (1d4/1d6) to decide direction, distance, or which micro-anomaly occurs.

## Table (d100)

| d100 | Effect |
|------|--------|
| 1 | **Chromatic Explosion.** Caster erupts with elemental energy. All creatures in a close/close/short/short/medium radius take 8/12/16/20/24 damage (roll 1d4: 1=fire, 2=frost, 3=lightning, 4=acid). Caster's skin briefly glows with the energy's color. |
| 2 | **Elemental Affinity.** Caster's body painfully attunes to an element. Roll 1d4: 1=fire, 2=frost, 3=lightning, 4=acid. Gain resistance to that element but weakness to its opposite (fire↔frost, lightning↔acid) for short/short/medium/medium/long duration. Caster's eyes glow and flicker with elemental energy. |
| 3 | **Temperature Shift.** Area undergoes extreme temperature change. All creatures in close/short/short/medium/medium area take 4/6/8/10/12 lasting damage each turn. Roll 1d2: 1=extreme heat (burning 2/4/6/8/10), 2=extreme cold (slowed condition). Lasts short/short/medium/medium/long duration. |
| 4 | **Static Field.** Arcs of lightning dance between all creatures. All creatures in close/close/short/short/medium radius take 8/12/16/20/24 lightning damage. Creatures in melee of each other take +4/+6/+8/+10/+12 additional damage (chain lightning). Hair stands on end for all affected. |
| 5 | **Frost Nova.** A pulse of freezing energy erupts from the caster. All creatures in close/close/short/short/medium radius take 10/14/18/22/26 frost damage (ignoring AV) and are briefly slowed. Caster's breath mists and skin frosts over. |
| 6 | **Flame Vortex.** A swirling fire column appears at a random point in medium range (GM chooses). Creatures entering or starting turn in close/close/short/short/medium radius take 4/6/8/10/12 fire damage per turn until end of scene. The column twists unnaturally, defying wind. |
| 7 | **Acid Rain.** Corrosive droplets fall from above in a random area within medium range (GM chooses or roll 1d8 for direction). Creatures in close/close/short/short/medium area take 10/14/18/22/26 acid damage (ignores half AV). Equipment hisses and smokes. |
| 8 | **Lightning Rod.** Caster becomes magnet for electrical energy. Caster briefly stunned and hair permanently stands on end. Next 1/1/2/2/3 lightning damage sources targeting anyone in short range redirect to caster (damage doubled) for brief/brief/short/short/medium duration. |
| 9 | **Elemental Weapon Infusion.** All held weapons in close/short/short/medium/medium radius gain +4/+6/+8/+10/+12 damage (roll element per weapon: 1d4 fire/frost/lightning/acid) for short/short/medium/medium/long duration. Weapons pulse and shimmer unnaturally with power. |
| 10 | **Pyroclasm.** Ground beneath caster cracks and releases gouts of flame. Caster's area becomes hazardous. Creatures entering or starting turn take 6/8/10/12/14 fire damage per turn for short/short/medium/medium/long duration. Caster's footsteps leave scorch marks. |
| 11 | **Gravity Reversal.** Gravity inverts in the area. All creatures in close/short/short/medium/medium radius float upward close/short/short/medium/medium distance and hover. At end of brief/short/short/medium/medium duration, they fall. Stomachs lurch unnaturally. |
| 12 | **Repulsion Wave.** A shockwave of force explodes outward from the caster. All creatures in close/close/short/short/medium radius pushed close/close/short/short/medium distance from caster and take 6/10/14/18/22 blast damage (ignoring AV). |
| 13 | **Attraction Field.** A point of crushing gravitational force manifests at a random location in medium range (GM chooses or roll 1d8 for direction). All creatures in close/short/short/medium/medium radius pulled close/close/short/short/medium distance toward it and take 6/10/14/18/22 blast damage (ignoring AV) from the crushing pressure. |
| 14 | **Kinetic Burst.** Raw kinetic force blasts outward from the caster's body. All creatures in melee of caster take 10/14/18/22/26 blast damage (ignoring AV) and pushed close distance. Caster's eyes briefly turn pure white. |
| 15 | **Levitation Lock.** Magic holds all creatures suspended just above the ground. All creatures in close/close/short/short/medium radius float close above ground. Movement becomes 0 unless flying, for brief/short/short/medium/medium duration. Inner ears scream wrongness. |
| 16 | **Crushing Pressure.** Intense pressure bears down from above. All creatures in close/close/short/short/medium radius take 10/14/18/22/26 blast damage (ignoring AV) and briefly stunned. Blood vessels burst in eyes. |
| 17 | **Whirlwind.** A violent vortex of wind forms around the caster. All creatures in close/close/short/short/medium radius roll STR + Athletics vs. TN 8/9/10/11/12. On fail, pushed close/short/short/medium/medium in random direction (roll 1d8) and take 4/6/8/10/12 damage from tumbling. |
| 18 | **Momentum Theft.** Caster steals kinetic energy from nearby creatures. All other creatures in close/close/short/short/medium radius have Movement reduced to 0 and take 4/6/8/10/12 damage (ignoring AV) as energy drains from their muscles. Caster gains +1/+1/+2/+2/+3 Movement for brief/brief/short/short/medium duration. |
| 19 | **Zero Gravity Zone.** Gravity ceases in caster's area. Close/close/short/short/medium radius becomes zero gravity. Creatures can fly/float but attacks suffer +1 bane (disorientation) for brief/short/short/medium/medium duration. Stomachs and sense of balance fail. |
| 20 | **Telekinetic Slam.** Invisible force slams all nearby creatures into the ground. All creatures in close/short/short/medium/medium radius take 10/14/18/22/26 blast damage (ignoring AV) and fall prone. Bones creak from impact. |
| 21 | **Random Teleport.** Reality warps and the caster vanishes. Caster teleports to random location within short/medium/medium/long/very long distance (GM determines unoccupied space). Caster briefly sees through walls during transit. |
| 22 | **Position Swap.** Caster swaps places with random creature in close/short/medium/medium/long range (roll randomly if multiple valid targets). Both experience momentary double-vision. |
| 23 | **Mass Teleportation.** 2/3/4/5/6 creatures in close/close/short/short/medium radius (including caster) teleport to random unoccupied locations in medium range (GM distributes or rolls for each). Space folds impossibly. |
| 24 | **Blink Step.** Caster gains hidden condition against all creatures for brief/brief/short/short/medium duration or until attacking. Caster appears as a barely-visible shimmer. |
| 25 | **Dimensional Anchor.** No teleportation in or out of close/short/short/medium/medium radius for short/short/medium/medium/long duration. Space feels thick and resistant. |
| 26 | **Scatter.** All creatures in close range (except caster) teleport to random unoccupied locations in medium range (GM distributes or rolls 1d8 for direction and distance for each). Affects 2/3/4/5/6 creatures. Reality briefly stutters. |
| 27 | **Spatial Anchor.** Reality attempts to return caster to a "stable" position. Caster immediately teleports to random location within close/short/short/medium/medium range (GM chooses). For brief/short/short/medium/medium duration, whenever caster moves, roll 1d6: on 1 they snap back to anchor point at end of movement. Position feels wrong and elastic. |
| 28 | **Phase Shift.** Caster gains resistance to physical damage but weakness to psychic and radiant for brief/short/short/medium/medium duration. Caster becomes translucent and voices sound distant. |
| 29 | **Displacement Field.** Caster creates illusory duplicates. Attacks against caster suffer +1/+1/+2/+2/+2 banes for brief/short/short/medium/medium duration. Multiple semi-transparent copies flicker around caster. |
| 30 | **Dimensional Door.** Portal appears at caster's location and another in short/medium/medium/long/very long range (GM chooses destination). Creatures can move through as if adjacent for brief/short/short/medium/medium duration. Portal edges shimmer with impossible colors. |
| 31 | **Random Polymorph.** Caster transforms into harmless beast (tier 0-1, GM choice - use Animal companion traits from Mounts & Companions). Retain mental attributes, gain physical attributes of form for brief/short/short/medium/medium duration. Transformation is painful. |
| 32 | **Size Shift.** Roll 1d6: 1-3 shrink one size, 4-6 grow one size. Adjust attributes (GM discretion) for brief/short/short/medium/medium duration. Clothing and equipment stretches or tightens uncomfortably. |
| 33 | **Mass Polymorph.** All creatures in close/close/short/short/medium radius transform into identical tiny harmless creatures (GM chooses form - use Animal companion traits). Retain mental attributes for brief/brief/short/short/medium duration. Bodies reshape with wet cracking sounds. |
| 34 | **Stone Flesh.** Caster gains +3/+4/+5/+6/+7 AV but AGI die decreases two steps (min d4) and Movement -1 for short/short/medium/medium/long duration. Skin becomes gray, stiff, and cracked like weathered stone. |
| 35 | **Gaseous Form.** Caster becomes mist. Immune to physical damage, can't attack or cast. Can move through small openings. Double damage from fire/lightning for brief/short/short/medium/medium duration. Body dissolves into vapor - deeply unsettling. |
| 36 | **Beast Aspect.** Caster gains traits from a beast companion for short/short/medium/medium/long duration. Roll 1d6: 1=Bear (use Bear companion traits), 2=Cat (use Cat companion traits), 3=Bird (use Bird companion traits), 4=Ape (use Ape companion traits), 5=Dog (use Dog companion traits), 6=Poisonous Snake (use Poisonous Snake companion traits). Physical features partially transform. |
| 37 | **Elemental Body.** Roll 1d4: 1=fire (burning 4/6/8/10/12 aura in melee, fire resistance), 2=water (breathe underwater, frost resistance), 3=air (hover, lightning resistance), 4=earth (+4/+6/+8/+10/+12 AV, physical resistance) for short/short/medium/medium/long duration. Body takes on element's substance partially. |
| 38 | **Age Shift.** Roll 1d2: 1=younger (AGI +1 die, STR -1 die), 2=older (MND +1 die, AGI -1 die) for short/short/medium/medium/long duration. Body visibly transforms to appropriate age. |
| 39 | **Spectral Form.** Caster becomes translucent, moves through objects (not creatures). Resistance to physical, weakness to radiant/force for brief/short/short/medium/medium duration. Can see own bones and organs faintly. |
| 40 | **Limb Multiplication.** Caster grows 1/1/2/2/3 extra arms from torso in unnatural positions. Can wield extra weapons/items. +1/+1/+2/+2/+3 boons on grapple for short/short/medium/medium/long duration. Arms writhe independently when idle. |
| 41 | **Mind Swap.** Caster and random creature in close/short/short/medium/medium range (roll if multiple) swap bodies. Each controls other's body but retains own mind. Mental attributes stay with mind, physical with body for brief/brief/short/short/medium duration. Profoundly disorienting. |
| 42 | **Shared Senses.** All creatures in close/close/short/short/medium radius telepathically share senses (see/hear what others see/hear). Overwhelming input causes all creatures in area to suffer +1/+1/+2/+2/+2 bane on all rolls for brief/short/short/medium/medium duration. Thoughts and perceptions bleed together. |
| 43 | **Mass Confusion.** Chaotic magic scrambles thoughts and senses. All creatures in close/close/short/short/medium radius (including caster) become confused for brief/brief/short/short/medium duration. Colors taste wrong, sounds have texture. |
| 44 | **Phantom Army.** Illusory magic creates 1/1/2/2/3 duplicate images of each creature in close/short/short/medium/medium radius. All attacks in the area suffer +1/+1/+2/+2/+2 banes (hard to distinguish real targets from illusions) for brief/short/short/medium/medium duration. Duplicates move independently, unnervingly. |
| 45 | **Telepathic Broadcast.** All creatures in close/short/medium/medium/long range hear caster's surface thoughts involuntarily. Caster has disadvantage on social rolls for short/short/medium/medium/long duration. Cannot hide intentions or lies. |
| 46 | **Sensory Chaos.** Magic distorts senses in close/close/short/short/medium radius. All creatures in area experience hallucinations (colors swap, sounds mislead, smells overwhelm, textures lie). All affected creatures suffer +1/+1/+2/+2/+2 bane on Perception for brief/short/short/medium/medium duration. |
| 47 | **Fear Aura.** Primal terror emanates from the caster's distorted face. All creatures in close/close/short/short/medium radius (except caster) become frightened of caster for brief/brief/short/short/medium duration. Caster's shadow moves wrong. |
| 48 | **Charm Wave.** A pulse of beguiling magic washes over all who see the caster. All creatures in close/short/short/medium/medium radius that can see caster become charmed for brief/brief/short/short/medium duration. Caster's eyes swirl with hypnotic patterns. |
| 49 | **Mirror Dimension.** Illusory mirror-world overlaps reality in close/short/short/medium/medium radius. All creatures in area see false reflections (movement in wrong directions, false obstacles). All affected creatures suffer +1/+1/+2/+2/+2 bane on physical rolls for brief/short/short/medium/medium duration. Reflections sometimes move first. |
| 50 | **Psychic Scream.** A mental shriek radiates from the caster's mind. All creatures in close/close/short/short/medium radius take 10/14/18/22/26 psychic damage (ignoring AV) and briefly dazed. Ears bleed though no sound occurred. |
| 51 | **Random Summon.** Summon random creature at random close location (GM chooses). Roll 1d6 for tier: 1-2=tier 0, 3-4=tier 1, 5-6=tier 2. Use Animal, Elemental, or Undead companion traits from Mounts & Companions based on environment. Roll 1d6 for disposition: 1-3=hostile to all, 4-5=confused/neutral, 6=friendly to caster. Lasts until end of scene or dismissed. Appears with unnatural shimmer. |
| 52 | **Weapon Rain.** The sky darkens as countless weapons fall like rain in close/short/short/medium/medium radius. All creatures take 10/14/18/22/26 physical damage (ignoring half AV). Ground littered with weapons that fade at end of scene. |
| 53 | **Animated Conjuration.** Random mundane objects materialize and clutter the area. close/short/short/medium/medium radius becomes difficult terrain for short/medium/medium/long/long duration. Creatures entering area roll AGI + Athletics vs. TN 8/9/10/11/12 or take 4/6/8/10/12 bludgeoning damage (tripped by animate objects). Objects move with eerie intention. |
| 54 | **Swarm Summon.** A swarm of distracting creatures (insects/bats/rats with glowing eyes) fills close/short/short/medium/medium radius. Harmless but crawl on everyone. All creatures in area suffer +1/+1/+2/+2/+2 bane on all rolls (distraction) for short/short/medium/medium/long duration. Swarm whispers unintelligibly. |
| 55 | **Splintered Self.** Create a duplicate with half HP and -1 die to all attributes (round down). Acts independently (GM controls). Roll 1d2: on a 1 the duplicate is allied but unsettling; on a 2 it is hostile and knows caster's weaknesses. Lasts short/short/medium/medium/long duration or until destroyed. Duplicate has wrongly-colored eyes. |
| 56 | **Elemental Spawn.** Summon tier 0/1/1/2/2 elemental (roll 1d4: fire/water/air/earth - use Elemental companion traits from Mounts & Companions). Hostile to all, attacks nearest. Lasts short/medium/medium/long/long duration or until destroyed. Burns/drowns/suffocates air unnaturally. |
| 57 | **Wall of Matter.** Wall appears in close range. Roll 1d4: 1=stone (20/30/40/50/60 HP, blocks movement), 2=ice (15/22/30/37/45 HP, frost damage 3/5/7/9/11 to creatures passing through), 3=thorns (10/15/20/25/30 HP, 3/5/7/9/11 damage to melee attackers), 4=force (30/45/60/75/90 HP, shimmers impossibly). Height close/close/short/short/medium, length short/short/medium/medium/long. Lasts medium/medium/long/long/long duration. |
| 58 | **Feast of Flesh.** A grotesque banquet materializes with disturbing abundance. Close/short/short/medium/medium radius fills with writhing, pulsing food. Consuming any (takes 1 Action) restores 8/12/16/20/24 HP and removes deprived, but eater must roll Spirit + Fortitude vs. TN 8/9/10/11/12 or become briefly nauseated (-1 bane all rolls). Food writhes and whispers. Non-consumed food transforms into 1d4 aggressive tier 0 creatures (use Rat companion traits) after brief/brief/short/short/medium duration. Vanishes at scene end. |
| 59 | **Phantom Steed.** Summon a spectral steed with 10/15/20/25/30 HP, Movement 3 (use Horse companion traits). Carries caster plus gear for short/medium/medium/long/long duration or until destroyed. The steed is temperamental — each time it moves, roll 1d6: on a 1 it bolts in a random direction; rider must roll AGI + Athletics vs. TN 8/9/10/11/12 or be thrown prone (1d6 damage) and displaced 1 area. Hooves don't quite touch ground. |
| 60 | **Trap Conjuration.** 1/2/2/3/3 magical traps appear in close/short/medium/medium/long radius (GM places strategically). Creatures entering space roll AGI + Athletics vs. TN 8/9/10/11/12 or take 8/12/16/20/24 damage (type varies by trap). Lasts medium/medium/long/long/long duration. Traps shimmer faintly before triggering. |
| 61 | **Earthquake.** The ground violently shakes and buckles. All creatures in close/short/short/medium/medium radius roll STR + Athletics vs. TN 8/9/10/11/12 or fall prone and take 6/10/14/18/22 damage. Area becomes difficult terrain for short/short/medium/medium/long duration. Aftershocks continue randomly. |
| 62 | **Fog Bank.** Thick, impenetrable fog rolls in with unnatural speed. All areas in close/short/medium/medium/long radius become heavily obscured (total darkness for vision) for short/short/medium/medium/long duration. Fog tastes metallic. |
| 63 | **Windstorm.** Powerful winds buffet close/short/short/medium/medium radius. All creatures in area have Movement -1 (min 0) and ranged attacks suffer +1/+2/+2/+2/+2 banes (wind deflection) for short/short/medium/medium/long duration. Wind howls with almost-words. |
| 64 | **Thunderstorm.** Dark clouds gather and lightning strikes erratically. Random creatures in short/short/medium/medium/long radius struck by lightning each turn (roll 1d6 per creature: 1-2=struck for 10/14/18/22/26 lightning damage) for short/medium/medium/long/long duration. Thunder shakes bones. |
| 65 | **Blizzard.** Howling winds and freezing snow fill the area. All areas in short/medium/medium/long/long radius become difficult terrain. Creatures take 4/6/8/10/12 frost damage per turn. Visibility reduced to close for short/short/medium/medium/long duration. Ice forms on skin. |
| 66 | **Mudslide.** Ground turns to thick, clinging mud in close/short/short/medium/medium radius. All areas become difficult terrain. Creatures in area need +1 Movement to move (slowed by clinging mud) and suffer +1/+1/+2/+2/+2 bane on AGI rolls for short/medium/medium/long/long duration. Mud writhes like it's alive. |
| 67 | **Light Show.** Brilliant, pulsing lights erupt in dazzling patterns. Close/short/medium/medium/long radius illuminated as bright daylight. Creatures with darkvision/light sensitivity briefly blinded each turn for short/short/medium/medium/long duration. Colors never seen before sear vision. |
| 68 | **Darkness Wave.** All light is snuffed out as absolute darkness spreads. All light in close/short/medium/medium/long radius extinguished. Total darkness (even darkvision can't see). Only magical light pierces for short/short/medium/medium/long duration. Darkness feels thick, suffocating. |
| 69 | **Plant Growth.** Vines, roots, and vegetation burst forth explosively. All areas in close/short/short/medium/medium radius overgrown. Difficult terrain. Creatures can choose to be restrained (grants +2/+3/+4/+5/+6 Defense vs. ranged) for medium/medium/long/long/long duration. Plants move and grasp. |
| 70 | **Lava Pool.** The ground cracks and molten rock wells up. Area in close/close/short/short/medium radius transforms to lava. Creatures entering or starting turn take 12/16/20/24/28 fire damage (ignoring AV) for medium/medium/long/long/long duration. Air shimmers with heat. |
| 71 | **Antimagic Pulse.** A ripple of nullifying energy spreads outward. All magic (spells, enchantments, items) in close/close/short/short/medium radius suppressed. Resume when duration ends or leaving area for brief/short/short/medium/medium duration. Magic items feel cold and dead. |
| 72 | **Mana Maelstrom.** A roiling cloud of raw mana crashes through the area. All spellcasters in close/short/short/medium/medium radius gain +2/+3/+4/+5/+6 Focus, but all spells cast while within the maelstrom have +1 Difficulty increase for short/short/medium/medium/long duration. Each spell cast has 25% chance for minor misfire (GM decides effect). Mana crackles visibly in air. |
| 73 | **Spell Reflection.** Next 1/1/2/2/3 spells targeting anyone in close/short/short/medium/medium radius reflected back at caster for short/medium/medium/long/long duration. Reflected spells leave glowing trails through air. |
| 74 | **Wild Zone.** Spells cast in close/close/short/short/medium radius trigger additional wild surge roll (but that roll doesn't cascade) for short/medium/medium/long/long duration. Space itself feels unstable and wrong. |
| 75 | **Spell Theft.** All other spellcasters in close/close/short/short/medium radius lose 2/4/6/8/10 Focus (to minimum 0). Caster gains half that Focus (up to max). Stolen Focus appears as glowing motes flowing through air. |
| 76 | **Magic Backlash.** All spellcasters in close/short/short/medium/medium radius (including caster) take 10/14/18/22/26 psychic damage (ignoring AV). Spell catalysts crack and smoke. |
| 77 | **Dispel Cascade.** A wave of unraveling magic sweeps through the area. All active spell effects in close/short/medium/medium/long radius end immediately (doesn't affect permanent items). Magic unweaves visibly like burning thread. |
| 78 | **Enchantment Overload.** All magic items in close/short/short/medium/medium radius gain enhanced power (+1 bonuses, +4/+6/+8/+10/+12 damage) but become inert for short duration after brief/short/short/medium/medium duration ends. Items glow and hum with excess power. |
| 79 | **Mana Leak.** Spellcasters in close/short/short/medium/medium radius lose +2/+3/+4/+5/+6 extra Focus when casting for short/short/medium/medium/long duration. Focus visibly bleeds away as colored smoke. |
| 80 | **Spell Siphon.** Magic drains from all creatures in area. All spellcasters in close/short/short/medium/medium radius lose 2/4/6/8/10 Focus (to minimum 0) and take 6/10/14/18/22 psychic damage (ignoring AV). Drained energy explodes as 1/1/2/2/3 random spell effects targeting random creatures in area (GM chooses spell effects from rank 0-1 spells). Arcane energy crackles wildly. |
| 81 | **Healing Bloom.** A warm surge of restorative energy bursts outward. All creatures in close/short/short/medium/medium radius regain 8/12/16/20/24 HP, but lingering wild energy leaves unstable regeneration: creatures healed take +2/+3/+4/+5/+6 damage from next source that hits them. Wounds close with faint glowing scars. |
| 82 | **Vampiric Aura.** All other creatures in close/close/short/short/medium radius lose 8/12/16/20/24 HP (ignoring AV) as life force drains away. Caster regains half total drained but veins bulge and darken visibly. |
| 83 | **Regenerative Field.** A persistent field bathes the area in slow mending energy. All creatures in close/close/short/short/medium radius regain 4/6/8/10/12 HP per turn for short/short/medium/medium/long duration. The field siphons from surroundings — nonliving matter ages (rust, fraying, decay). Regenerating flesh squirms unnaturally. |
| 84 | **Life Link.** Creatures in close/close/short/short/medium radius share damage and healing equally for brief/short/short/medium/medium duration. Faint red threads connect all linked creatures visibly. Taking damage pulls on the threads painfully. |
| 85 | **Wild Vigor.** The air thrums with life. All creatures in close/short/short/medium/medium radius gain 8/12/16/20/24 temporary HP and +1 Movement for short/short/medium/medium/long duration. When surge fades, roll 1d6 per affected creature: on 1-2 they're briefly nauseated (-1 to next action) as borrowed vigor violently departs. Muscles twitch and spasm. |
| 86 | **Death Ward.** Next time caster or 1/1/2/2/3 allies in close range would reach 0 HP, remain at 1 HP instead for short/medium/medium/long/long duration. Warded creatures have deathly pale appearance and cold skin. |
| 87 | **Affliction Burst.** Chaotic maladies erupt from the caster's body. All creatures in close/close/short/short/medium radius (including caster) suffer 1/1/2/2/3 random conditions for brief/short/short/medium/medium duration. Roll 1d8 per condition: 1=poisoned, 2=burning (4/6/8/10/12), 3=bleeding (2/3/4/5/6), 4=frightened (of random creature), 5=confused, 6=blinded, 7=deafened, 8=slowed. Conditions manifest as visible afflictions crawling over skin. |
| 88 | **Purging Wave.** Magic violently cleanses and disrupts in equal measure. All creatures in close/short/short/medium/medium radius have all conditions removed but take 8/12/16/20/24 damage (ignoring AV) and are briefly stunned as their body convulses. Even beneficial effects are stripped away painfully. Skin briefly becomes translucent during purge. |
| 89 | **Necrotic Pulse.** All living in close/short/short/medium/medium radius take 10/14/18/22/26 necrotic damage (ignoring AV) as flesh withers. Undead regain that amount as HP. Living flesh grays momentarily. |
| 90 | **Chaotic Vitality.** Raw life energy floods the caster unpredictably. Caster regains 12/16/20/24/28 HP and recovers 1/1/2/2/3 Fatigue, but simultaneously suffers 1/1/2/2/3 random mutations (roll on Mutation Table - these mutations last for short/medium/medium/long/long duration, not permanent). Body reshapes itself violently. Caster screams as flesh warps and reforms. |
| 91 | **Time Hiccup.** All creatures in close/short/short/medium/medium radius (including caster) re-roll Initiative. Use new values. Everyone experiences brief déjà vu. |
| 92 | **Slow Field.** All creatures in close/close/short/short/medium radius become slowed and can only take Quick Action or Action (not both) for brief/brief/short/short/medium duration. Movement appears stuttery, leaving afterimages. |
| 93 | **Haste Aura.** All creatures in close/close/short/short/medium radius gain +1 Action and +1 Movement but are briefly exhausted (-1 bane all rolls) when duration ends for brief/brief/short/short/medium duration. Hearts race dangerously fast. |
| 94 | **Turn Theft.** Random creature in close/short/medium/medium/long range (roll if multiple) loses next turn and stands frozen. Caster gains additional Action next turn. Stolen time appears as spectral echo. |
| 95 | **Fate Echo.** For short/short/medium/medium/long duration caster may once per turn replace a single roll with a reroll, choosing which result to use. Each use risks temporal feedback — after using, caster suffers +1 bane to next mental roll as fate frays. Caster briefly sees both timelines. |
| 96 | **Temporal Fracture.** Time splinters into parallel moments. All creatures in close/short/short/medium/medium radius (including caster) exist in two timelines simultaneously for brief/brief/short/short/medium duration. When taking an action, roll 1d2: on 1 the action succeeds normally, on 2 the action happens in the "other" timeline and has no effect (but resources are still spent). Creatures flicker between positions. Can see ghostly afterimages of what "could have been." |
| 97 | **Temporal Flux.** The caster's age shifts unpredictably. Roll 1d2: 1=briefly become child (AGI +1 die, STR -1 die, cannot regain HP naturally) for brief/short/short/medium/medium duration; 2=temporarily become oldtimer (MND +1 die, AGI -1 die, cannot regain HP naturally) for same duration. Transformation is physical and disconcerting. Equipment resizes with effort. |
| 98 | **Temporal Displacement.** Attacks against caster suffer +1/+1/+2/+2/+2 banes (partially out of sync with time). Caster's attacks gain +1/+1/+2/+2/+2 boons for brief/short/short/medium/medium duration. Caster appears slightly transparent and delayed. |
| 99 | **Causal Break.** Caster can have effects before causes (take action after seeing result, attack before moving to range, declare defense after damage roll, etc.). GM determines reasonable limits. Lasts brief/brief/short/short/medium duration. Others perceive caster moving backward and forward simultaneously. |
| 100 | **Reality Ripple.** Roll on this table three times (ignore further 100s). Apply all simultaneously. Most recent takes precedence if contradictory. These rolls don't trigger further cascades. Reality cracks audibly. |

## Optional: Permanent Mutations

**GM Option:** For campaigns where wild surge exposure leaves lasting marks, each time a caster triggers a wild surge effect, they may develop a permanent mutation. Roll 1d12 on the Mutation Table below and advance that mutation by one stage. If you roll a mutation you've already progressed, advance it to the next stage (up to Stage 4 maximum).

### Mutation Stages

Each mutation progresses through four stages with repeated exposure:

- **Stage 1 (Subtle):** Barely noticeable cosmetic change
- **Stage 2 (Noticeable):** Obvious physical alteration
- **Stage 3 (Empowered):** Cosmetic intensifies + minor trade-off (small flaw and trait)
- **Stage 4 (Transformed):** Full trade-off (significant flaw and powerful trait)

### GM Guidance

- **Frequency:** Each wild surge trigger prompts a mutation roll. For campaigns where this feels too fast, consider requiring multiple triggers before rolling (e.g., every 3rd or 5th wild surge effect).
- **Player Choice:** Consider letting players choose their mutation (with GM approval) instead of rolling randomly to ensure it fits their character concept.
- **Removal:** Powerful magic, divine intervention, or quest rewards might reverse mutations. Alternatively, embrace them as permanent character evolution.
- **Multiple Mutations:** Players can develop multiple mutations. Track each separately through its stages. A character might have Stage 4 Crystalline Eyes and Stage 2 Temporal Scarring simultaneously.
- **RP Opportunities:** Each stage offers roleplaying hooks. NPCs react to visible changes; casters might seek mentors or cures; mutations could become plot threads.
