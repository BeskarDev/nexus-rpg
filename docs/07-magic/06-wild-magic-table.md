# ðŸŽ² Wild Magic Table

![banner-img](/img/banner/magic-banner.png)

## Overview

When you blunder an arcane spell roll, roll 1d100 on the Wild Magic Table and immediately resolve the result. Wild magic effects are powerful, unpredictable, and always temporary. They trigger before any other post-cast effects.

### Resolution

1. **Roll 1d100** immediately after confirming the blunder
2. **Determine Effect Intensity** based on the blundered spell's rank
3. **Apply the Effect** following the entry's targeting rules
4. **Pay Focus Cost** as normal for the blundered spell

### Targeting Rules

- **Nearest by Distance**: When multiple valid targets exist, choose the nearest by straight-line distance. If tied, choose randomly among tied candidates.
- **Default to Caster**: If no valid target exists, the effect targets the caster unless stated otherwise.
- **Random Selection**: When an entry specifies "random [ally/enemy/creature/object]", roll uniformly among all valid candidates within range.
- **Area Origin**: Area effects originate from the caster's space unless specified otherwise.

### Intensity Scaling by Spell Rank

Each entry scales based on the blundered spell's rank:

| **Rank** | **Intensity** | **Typical Scale** |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| 0 | Light | Minimal effects, brief duration |
| 1 | Standard | Basic effects, short duration |
| 2 | Strong | Moderate effects, medium duration |
| 3 | Potent | Significant effects, medium duration |
| 4 | Very Potent | Powerful effects, long duration |
| 5 | Extreme | Maximum effects, long duration |

**Scaling Parameters** (vary by entry):
- Number of targets (1/2/3/4/5/6)
- Radius/range (close/short/medium/long/very long/extreme)
- Damage/healing dice (varies by entry)
- Condition duration (briefly/short/medium/long)
- Save DC adjustments (+0/+1/+2/+3/+4/+5)
- Effect magnitude multipliers

- **By Rank**: Radius close/short/short/medium/medium/long.

**100. Reality Ripple**
The fabric of reality distorts dramatically.
- **Effect**: Roll on this table three times, ignoring results of 100. Apply all three results simultaneously. If this would cause contradictory effects, the most recent takes precedence. Wild magic effects triggered by Reality Ripple cannot themselves trigger additional wild magic table rolls (to prevent infinite recursion).
- **By Rank**: Effects scale based on the blundered spell's rank.

## Talent Interaction Rules

### Default: No Direct Influence

By default, talents **cannot** modify the d100 roll result. Talents may interact with wild magic effects through:

- **Containment**: Reduce area of effect by one step
- **Redirection**: Redirect targeting to self instead of random
- **Mitigation**: Reduce harmful effects by one rank step
- **Shielding**: Grant one ally +boons on saves against the effect

### Optional: Limited Influence (GM Discretion)

If the GM permits talents that influence wild magic rolls, they must be **rare, costly, and bounded**:

**Example Limited Influence Options**:
- **Wild Luck** (once per scene): After seeing the d100 result, spend 1 Resolve to reroll. Must accept the second result and take +1 bane on your next spell roll.
- **Chaos Channeling** (once per long rest): Roll 2d100, choose one result. The other effect happens to a random creature within medium range.
- **Harmonic Surge** (twice per day): Nudge the d100 result by Â±5 after rolling. Take psychic damage equal to the shift amount (ignoring AV).

**Strict Limits**:
- Only one modification per wild magic event
- No stacking multiple talents or abilities
- Cannot create permanent effects or bypass table constraints
- Cost must be significant (Resolve, HP, limited uses, penalties)

## Deliberate Triggers and Random Downside Hooks

Characters may sometimes trigger wild magic intentionally in exchange for power. These are always **opt-in** and carry **clear risks**:

### Trigger Patterns

**Overchannel** (Talent example)
- **Cost**: Spend additional Focus equal to spell rank
- **Benefit**: Cast the spell as if one rank higher
- **Downside**: After resolving the spell, roll on the wild magic table

**Unstable Focus** (Magic item property)
- **Benefit**: Grants +1 boon on spell rolls while wielding
- **Downside**: On a roll of 1 on the d6, trigger wild magic surge

**Gambit: Chaos Blast** (Metamagic example)
- **Cost**: 2 additional Focus
- **Benefit**: The spell targets all creatures in a radius instead of single target
- **Downside**: Roll on wild magic table after casting

**Wild Node Environment**
- **Description**: Casting spells in areas of unstable magic (ley line confluences, magical disaster sites, etc.)
- **Mechanic**: When casting spells in a wild node, roll Spirit + Arcana vs. Medium (8). On a failure, trigger a wild magic surge.

### Implementation Guidelines

- Triggers are **opt-in** or clearly signposted risks
- Players choose power at the cost of randomness
- Assign costs: resources, Fatigue, limited uses per scene/day
- Effects scale by spell rank as normal
- If a deliberate trigger produces an especially beneficial result, consider halving duration or adding a minor drawback

### Example Optional Talents

**Wild Surge (Arcana Talent - Rank 3)**
- **Requirement**: Arcana 3+
- **Effect**: Once per scene when you cast a spell, you can choose to trigger a wild magic surge as part of casting. If the surge result is harmful to you, the spell you cast gains +1 rank effectiveness (but costs the same Focus). If beneficial, the spell proceeds normally.
- **Limit**: Once per scene

**Chaos Gambler (Arcana Talent - Rank 5)**
- **Requirement**: Arcana 5+
- **Effect**: When you would trigger wild magic (from any source), you can spend 2 Resolve to roll twice on the table and choose which result occurs.
- **Limit**: Once per scene, costs 2 Resolve

## Template for New Entries

When adding new wild magic effects, follow this structure:

### [Number]. [Effect Name]
[One-sentence thematic description]
- **Effect**: [Mechanical description with clear targeting]
- **By Rank**: [List scaling parameters for ranks 0/1/2/3/4/5]

**Example**:

### X. Gravity Storm
Localized gravity becomes chaotic and unpredictable.
- **Effect**: All creatures in radius must roll STR + Athletics vs. TN each turn or be knocked prone and take blast damage. Ranged attacks suffer +banes.
- **By Rank**: Radius close/short/short/medium/medium/long, TN 8/9/10/11/12/13, Damage 3/5/7/9/11/13, Banes +1/+2/+2/+3/+3/+4, Duration short/short/medium/medium/long/long.

### Extending the Table

GMs can create custom entries beyond 100:
1. **Maintain the pattern**: Clear effect, scalable, temporary
2. **Use existing systems**: Conditions, damage types, distances already in the game
3. **Ensure variety**: Mix target types, effect categories, beneficial/harmful
4. **Playtest for balance**: Effects should feel powerful but not game-breaking
5. **Keep it fun**: Wild magic should create memorable moments, not frustration
