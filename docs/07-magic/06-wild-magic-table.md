# ðŸŽ² Wild Magic Table

![banner-img](/img/banner/magic-banner.png)

When you blunder a **rank 1 or higher** arcane spell, roll 1d100 and apply the result immediately. All effects are temporary.

**Targeting:** Choose nearest valid target by distance; if tied, random. Default to caster if no valid target exists.

**Scaling:** Effects list values for spell ranks 1/2/3/4/5 where applicable.

**Random Locations:** When an effect teleports creatures to "random locations," the GM chooses valid unoccupied spaces within the specified range, distributing them evenly around the area or rolling randomly for each creature's direction and distance.
