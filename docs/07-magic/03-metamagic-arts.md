# ðŸ§  Metamagic Arts

You can use a Metamagic Art you know by increasing the Focus cost as part of casting a spell. Your spell has itâ€™s normal effect in addition to the Metamagic Arts effects. You can only use one Metamagic Art per casting of a spell.

| Name | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Condensed Spell | +1 Focus cost on a spell vs. Dodge that deals damage to all creatures in range of the target location. Reduce the radius by one category (min. melee) and increase the damage by +1 per SL against each target. |
| Elemental Spell | +2 Focus cost to change a spellâ€™s damage type from acid, blast, fire, frost, lightning, necrotic, poison, or radiant to any other damage type within the list. If the spell deals damage multiple times or over multiple turns, the new damage type applies to all instances of damage the spell deals. |
| Empowered Spell | Increase the Focus cost by any amount up to your Arcana on a spell. You suffer +1 bane on the roll to cast the spell. On a hit, the spell deals +2 damage for each additional Focus you spend against a single enemy or +1 damage per extra Focus if the spell affects multiple enemies or deals damage multiple times. |
| Far Reaching Spell | +1 Focus cost to increase the range of a non-blast spell by one step (max. very long) or +2 Focus cost for a blast spell (max. long). |
| Forked Spell | +2 Focus cost on a spell against a single target. Cast the spell a second time against a different target, but you suffer +1 bane on both rolls. |
| Prolonged Spell | +1 Focus cost on a spell that lasts for a duration. Increase the duration by one step (up to a long duration). |
| Searing Spell | +2 Focus cost on a spell dealing damage to ignore resistances against the spellâ€˜s damage and treat damage immunities as resistances instead. |
| Shaped Spell | +1 Focus cost on a spell that affects multiple targets. You can exclude any number of targets from the spellâ€™s effect. |
| Silent Spell | +1 Focus to cast a non-ritual spell without giving away signs that you are doing so. Instead of speaking aloud as part of casting, you instead are capable to invoke your spell using subtle hand gestures. This also allows you to cast a spell while being silenced. Compare your spell roll to each potential creature's Resist, that could notice your silent spellcasting. If it is lower, they arenâ€™t aware of the spell being cast. |
| Quickened Spell | +2 Focus cost to either:<br/>- Reduce the casting time of a non-ritual spell to a Quick Action. You must still cast the spell on your turn.<br/>- Reduce the casting time of a ritual spell by one time interval (e.g. travel to exploration). A casting time of a delving turn is reduced to an Action instead. |
| Widened Spell | +2 Focus cost on a spell vs. Dodge that deals damage to all creatures in range of the target location. Increase the radius by one category (max. long) and decrease the damage by -2 per SL against each target. |
