# ðŸ§  Metamagic Arts
You can use a Metamagic Art you know by increasing the Focus cost as part of casting a spell. Your spell has itâ€™s normal effect in addition to the Metamagic Arts effects. You can only use one Metamagic Art per casting of a spell.

| Name | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Condensed Spell | +1 Focus cost on a spell vs. Dodge that deals damage to all creatures in range of the target location. Reduce the radius by one category (min. melee) and increase the damage by +1 per SL against each target. |
| Empowered Spell | Increase the Focus cost by any amount up to your Arcana on a spell. You suffer +1 bane on the roll to cast the spell. On a hit, the spell deals +2 damage for each additional Focus you spend against a single enemy or +1 damage per extra Focus if the spell affects multiple enemies. |
| Far Reaching Spell | +1 Focus cost to increase the range of a non-blast spell by one step (max. very long) or +2 Focus cost for a blast spell (max. long). |
| Forked Spell | +2 Focus cost on a spell against a single target. Cast the spell a second time against a different target, but you suffer +1 bane on both rolls. |
| Lifelike Spell | +1 Focus cost on an illusionary spell to increase the difficulty for any creature to see through the spellâ€™s illusion by one step. |
| Prolonged Spell | +1 Focus cost on a spell that lasts for a duration. Increase the duration by one step (up to a long duration). |
| Shaped Spell | +1 Focus cost on a spell that affects multiple targets. You can exclude any number of targets from the spellâ€™s effect. |
| Quickened Spell | +2 Focus cost to either:<br />- Reduce the casting time of a non-ritual spell to a Quick Action. You must still cast the spell on your turn.<br />- Reduce the casting time of a ritual spell by one time interval (e.g. travel to exploration). A casting time of a delving turn is reduced to an Action instead. |
| Widened Spell | +2 Focus cost on a spell vs. Dodge that deals damage to all creatures in range of the target location. Increase the radius by one category (max. long) and decrease the damage by -2 per SL against each target. |
