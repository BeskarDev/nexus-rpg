![banner-img](/img/banner/arcane-spells-banner.png)

Arcane magic represents the transgressive power of the mind, bending reality through sheer will and intellectual mastery. Arcane casters (Arcanists) channel raw magical energy through study, practice, and force of personality.

## Arcane Disciplines

Arcane magic is organized into six disciplines, each representing a different approach to manipulating reality:

### [Evocation](./evocation)
**Identity**: Transgressive elemental manipulation  
**Focus**: Offense, Control, Defense  
**Damage Types**: Fire, Frost, Lightning, Acid, Blast

The discipline of raw elemental power. Evocation spells unleash destructive forces, create elemental barriers, and inflict burning, chilling, shocking, corroding, or concussive effects on targets.

### [Illusion](./illusion)
**Identity**: Selfish deception and false reality  
**Focus**: Utility, Control, Support  
**Damage Types**: Psychic, Blast, Frost

Masters of misdirection and sensory manipulation. Illusion spells create false images, disguise reality, generate phantom creatures, and confuse the senses of enemies.

### [Conjuration](./conjuration)
**Identity**: Unnatural creation and forced summoning  
**Focus**: Utility, Offense, Support  
**Damage Types**: Physical, Blast, Acid

The art of bringing things into being or relocating them through space. Conjuration spells summon creatures and objects, enable teleportation, create extradimensional spaces, and bind entities to the caster's will.

### [Telepathy](./telepathy)
**Identity**: Exploitative mind control and violation  
**Focus**: Control, Utility, Support  
**Damage Types**: Psychic, Radiant, Necrotic

The discipline of mental domination and psychic intrusion. Telepathy spells read minds, implant suggestions, charm or dominate targets, alter memories, and create telepathic bonds.

### [Telekinetics](./telekinetics)
**Identity**: Transgressive force without physical contact  
**Focus**: Utility, Offense, Defense  
**Damage Types**: Physical, Blast, Lightning

The power to move objects and creatures through mental force alone. Telekinetic spells move objects at a distance, create force barriers, levitate creatures, crush targets, and manipulate gravity.

### [Necromancy](./necromancy)
**Identity**: Selfish manipulation of death and life force  
**Focus**: Control, Offense, Utility  
**Damage Types**: Necrotic, Poison, Physical

The dark art of manipulating life and death. Necromancy spells drain life force, animate the dead, accelerate decay, communicate with the deceased, and manipulate corpses.

## Learning Arcane Spells

- **Spell Power**: Your arcane spell power equals ½ your Mind attribute
- **Focus**: Your maximum Focus equals (Mind - 2) + (2 × Arcana rank)
- **Disciplines**: You can know multiple disciplines, but must learn at least one rank 0 spell in a discipline before learning higher-ranked spells
- **Spell Selection**: Use the Arcane Spell Knowledge talent to learn new spells

## Casting Arcane Spells

- **Casting Roll**: Mind + Arcana vs. Target Number or vs. enemy Defense
- **Focus Cost**: Each spell has a Focus cost that must be paid when casting
- **Mishaps**: If you fail to cast an arcane spell, roll on the Arcane Mishap table
- **Attributes**: Arcane magic is transgressive and selfish - it represents personal power gained through study and will
