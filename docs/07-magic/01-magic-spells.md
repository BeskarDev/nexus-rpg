# 🔮 Magic & Spells

## Magic

### Learning a magic skill

Any character can only learn of of the two magic skills. When first learning one of the two magic skills, you gain the following traits for it.

### Arcana

Arcane magic channels the power of the caster’s mind. You can create magical effects from nothing, and even channel magic from strange places with unknown origin.

Being an arcanist was, for the longest time, considered to be a heretical mutation and such individuals were shunned from their communities. But since the arcane awakening of the humans, the usefulness of these arcanists as members of court and weapons of war was slowly acknowledged.

- Your Spell Base Damage is 1/2 your Mind.
- Your Focus is equal to (Mind - 2) + (2 x Arcana).
- Choose your first discipline and learn two rank 0 spells for it.
- Whenever you gain a rank in Arcana, learn two new spells of equal or lower rank for any discipline you learned or adopt a new discipline and learn one rank 0 spell for it.
- You must be holding an arcane conduit in your hand to cast arcane spells.

**Arcane Disciplines**

Arcane Disciplines stand in no direct relation to one another, but display the various types of influence someone can enact by their mental powers.

- Evocation (*fire, frost, lightning*)
- Illusion (*trickery, misdirection, obfuscation*)
- Conjuration (*objects, creatures, teleportation*)
- Telepathy (*influence, communicate, insight*)
- Telekinetics (*move, repel, levitate*)
- Necromancy (*decay, undeath, siphoning*)

### Mysticism

Mystic magic manipulates the world around you and channels it’s energy to turn into spells.

Practicing mystic magic can take many forms. Devoting yourself to a god and channeling it‘s magic, or communing with the spirits of the world directly. Almost every community has at least one person among them practicing mystic magic. From the shaman of the village, over a circle of witches, to a full priesthood to a major deity.

- Your Spell Base Damage is 1/2 your Spirit.
- Your Focus is equal to (Spirit - 2) + (2 x Mysticism).
- Choose your traditions and learn two rank 0 spells for them. You can either choose:
    - Devotion (choose one tradition, you learn +1 spell for it immediately and whenever you learn new spells from gaining a rank in Mysticism)
    - Balance (choose two opposing traditions)
    - Scholar (choose three traditions, but neither of them can oppose another one of them)
- Whenever you gain a rank in Mysticism, learn two new spells of equal or lower rank for any tradition you learned.
- You must be holding a mystic talisman in your hand to cast mystic spells.

**Mystic Traditions**

Mystic Traditions are grouped up into opposing ideals. Most practitioners of mysticism learn the aspects of multiple traditions, though some choose to devote themselves fully to a single tradition.

- Light (*sun, illumination, truth*) — Twilight (*moon, dreams, secrets*)
- Life (*vitality, blessings, community*) — Death (*plagues, curses, fear*)
- Nature (*earth, animals, plants*) — Tempest (*storms, earthquakes, lava*)
- Peace (*calmness, protection, selflessness*) — War (*fury, violence, pride*)

## Spells

### Focus

Focus represents your ability to cast spells. If you don’t have Arcana or Mysticism learned, you have 0 Focus. If you have learned one of the skills, your Focus is calculated as described above.

Whenever you attempt to cast a spell, you can only do so, if you have 1 or more Focus remaining. After the spell is cast, you are required to spend it‘s Focus Cost on a success or blunder. If you would ever go below 0 Focus from a spell’s effect, instead reduce your HP by 2 for each point of Focus you would have to spend below 0. If this damage reduces your HP to 0, you suffer Fatigue from it.

|  | Rank 0 | Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 3 | Rank 4 | Rank 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| d4 Attribute | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 |
| d6 Attribute | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 | 14 |
| d8 Attribute | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 | 14 | 16 |
| d10 Attribute | 8 | 10 | 12 | 14 | 16 | 18 |
| d12 Attribute | 10 | 12 | 14 | 16 | 18 | 20 |

### Casting a spell

You cast a spell by rolling either Mind + Arcana for arcane spells, or Spirit + Mysticism for mystic spells.

**Blunder.** The spell fails. Spend the spell’s Focus Cost.

**Failure.** The spell fails but you don‘t have to spend it’s Focus Cost.

**Success.** The spell takes effect based on your SL. Spend the spell’s Focus Cost.

You can only cast one spell of rank 1 or higher per turn. You can still cast another rank 0 spell in addition to it, if you cast one of the spells using your Quick Action.

| Spell Rank | Rank 0 | Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 3 | Rank 4 | Rank 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Focus Cost | 0 Focus | 2 Focus | 4 Focus | 6 Focus | 8 Focus | 10 Focus |

### Spell Damage

Many spells deal damage to one or more creatures. The first effect of a spell for a given SL usually lists it's spell damage, describing something like “Deals +X damage”. Similarly to weapons, spells also multiply their spell damage with increasing SL. Though, while for weapons this is described implicitly in the Attacking section, each spell lists their total spell damage for each SL directly within it's effect.

When a spell's effect lists “+X damage” or “+X HP”, also add your Spell Base Damage to that number.

### Spell Concentration

Some spells require Concentration to be cast. These spells most often have continuous effects that last for a certain duration. You can only concentration on once such spell at a time. Each time you take damage, while concentrating on a spell, you have to roll Spirit + Fortitude. If you fail this roll, your spell ends immediately. The difficulty of the roll depends on the amount of damage that you took.

| Damage Taken | 5 or less | 6-10 | 11-20 | 21-30 | 31 or more |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Difficulty | easy (6) | moderate (8) | hard (10) | very hard (12) | extremely hard (14) |

### Bending Spell Effects

The effects of any given spell describe the most general use case for it. But any crafty spell caster might want to do something with their spells that isn’t directly supported by their effects but would fit within the general description of how the spell acts and works.

In this case, you can attempt to bend the spell’s effect.

> Note, that bending spell effects is different to arcane spell casters ability to alter spells with their Metamagic Arts. Bending spell effects is generally less potent than that.
> 

When doing so, describe your intention with the bend spell effect and how you would accomplish this to the GM. The GM can then decide if this bend effect still fits the general idea of the spell and how it might work within the rules.

As a guide to the GM in deciding, the following rules should always be followed when bending a spell’s effect:

- All creatures able to see you are assumed to understand that you attempt to cast a spell. You may be able to cast a spell stealthily if it only requires a Quick Action, or by imposing +1 bane on casting a non-ritual spell (GM‘s discretion).
- Any spell with a physical effect targeting creatures can also be directed at objects or surfaces.
- Any physical form the spell effect takes or produces vanishes after the spells duration, unless the spell specifically states otherwise.
- Any physical substance the spell effect produces provides no nutritious value and can’t be used in place of food or drink, unless the spell specifically states otherwise.
- When any spell effect influences the mind or actions of a creature, they are aware that the thoughts or actions are not their own. If they also saw you casting the spell, they are also aware of you being the source of the effect.
- Any spell that targets a location can do so anywhere on the ground, along a wall, or even in the air, provided the physical effect of the spell can reasonably take form at the chosen location (e.g. you can’t make a vine grow in the air without some ground or wall).
- You can treat a rank 0 spell as continuous, provided you aren’t in combat or any other kind of danger.
- You can’t bend the spell’s number of targets.
