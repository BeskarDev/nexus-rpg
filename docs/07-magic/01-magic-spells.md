# 🔮 Magic & Spells

## Magic

### Learning a magic skill

Any character can only learn one of the two magic skills Arcana and Mysticism. When first learning one of the two magic skills, you gain the following traits for it.

### Arcana

Arcane magic channels the power of the caster’s mind. You can create magical effects from nothing, and even channel magic from strange places with unknown origins.

Being an arcanist was, for the longest time, considered to be a heretical mutation, and such individuals were shunned from their communities. But since the arcane awakening of the humans, the usefulness of these arcanists as members of the court and weapons of war was slowly acknowledged.

- Your Spell Power is 1/2 your Mind.
- Your Focus is equal to (Mind - 2) + (2 x Arcana).
- Choose your first discipline and learn two rank 0 spells for it.
- Whenever you gain a rank in Arcana, learn two new spells of equal or lower rank for any discipline you learned or adopt a new discipline and learn one rank 0 spell for it.
- You must be holding an arcane conduit as a Spell Catalyst in your hand to cast arcane spells.

**Arcane Origin**

- Studied (only available to humans)
- Inherited
- Exposed

**Arcane Disciplines**

Arcane Disciplines stand in no direct relation to one another but display the various types of influence someone can enact by their mental powers.

- Evocation (*fire, frost, lightning*)
- Illusion (*trickery, misdirection, obfuscation*)
- Conjuration (*objects, creatures, teleportation*)
- Telepathy (*influence, communication, insight*)
- Telekinetics (*move, repel, levitate*)
- Necromancy (*decay, undeath, siphoning*)

### Mysticism

Mystic magic manipulates the world around you and channels its energy by speaking Words of Power to turn into spells.

Practicing mystic magic can take many forms. Devoting yourself to a god and channeling its magic, or communing with the spirits of the world directly. Almost every community has at least one person among them practicing mystic magic. From the shaman of the village, over a circle of witches, to a full priesthood to a major deity.

- Your Spell Power is 1/2 your Spirit.
- Your Focus is equal to (Spirit - 2) + (2 x Mysticism).
- Choose your traditions in one of two ways (this can’t be changed afterwards):
    - **Balance.** Choose any two traditions and learn two spells from among them. Whenever you gain a rank in Mysticism, learn two new spells of equal or lower rank for any of your traditions.
    - **Devotion.** Choose one tradition and learn three spells from it. Whenever you gain a rank in Mysticism, learn three new spells of equal or lower rank for your tradition.
- You must be holding a mystic talisman as a Spell Catalyst in your hand to cast mystic spells.

**Mystic Pact**

When you make a pact with a god, goddess, or higher spirit to receive the divine ability to cast mystic spells, you must also swear to always adhere to your patron beings tenents. If you ever purposfully or repeatedly transgress them, you lose access to your spellcasting and must attone to regain them.

**Mystic Traditions**

Mystic Traditions are grouped up into opposing ideals. Most practitioners of mysticism learn the aspects of multiple traditions, though some choose to devote themselves fully to a single tradition.

- Light (*sun, illumination, truth*) — Twilight (*moon, dreams, secrets*)
- Life (*vitality, blessings, community*) — Death (*plagues, curses, fear*)
- Nature (*earth, animals, plants*) — Tempest (*storms, earthquakes, lava*)
- Peace (*calmness, protection, selflessness*) — War (*fury, violence, pride*)

## Spells

### Focus

Focus represents your ability to cast spells. If you don’t have Arcana or Mysticism learned, you have 0 Focus. If you have learned one of the skills, your Focus is calculated as described above.

Whenever you attempt to cast a spell, you can only do so, if you have 1 or more Focus remaining. After the spell is cast, you are required to spend its Focus Cost on a success or blunder. If you would ever go below 0 Focus from a spell’s effect, instead reduce your HP by 2 for each point of Focus you would have to spend below 0. If this damage reduces your HP to 0, you suffer Fatigue from it.

|  | Rank 0 | Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 3 | Rank 4 | Rank 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| d4 Attribute | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 |
| d6 Attribute | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 | 14 |
| d8 Attribute | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 | 14 | 16 |
| d10 Attribute | 8 | 10 | 12 | 14 | 16 | 18 |
| d12 Attribute | 10 | 12 | 14 | 16 | 18 | 20 |

### Casting a spell

You cast a spell by rolling either Mind + Arcana for arcane spells, or Spirit + Mysticism for mystic spells.

> Each spell **only** takes effect on a successful roll, as denoted by the target of the spell against which to roll.
When attempting to cast a spell at an object or location, which normally is targeted against a creature’s Defense, use the appropriate Difficulty for the spell’s rank instead (medium for rank 1, hard for rank 2, and so on).
> 

**Blunder.** The spell fails. Spend the spell’s Focus Cost.

**Failure.** The spell fails but you don‘t have to spend its Focus Cost.

**Success.** The spell takes effect based on your SL. Spend the spell’s Focus Cost.

| Spell Rank | Rank 0 | Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 3 | Rank 4 | Rank 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Focus Cost | 0 Focus | 2 Focus | 4 Focus | 6 Focus | 8 Focus | 10 Focus |

### Spell Damage

Many spells deal damage to one or more creatures. The first effect of a spell for a given SL usually lists its spell damage, describing something like “Deals +X damage”. Similarly to weapons, spells also multiply their spell damage with increasing SL. Though, while for weapons this is described implicitly in the Attacking section, each spell lists the total spell damage for each SL directly within its effect.

When a spell's effect lists “+X damage” for damage or “+X HP” for healing, use your Spell Power (1/2 Mind/Spirit) as a base value, and add that number to it, as well as any other damage or healing modifiers.

Inversely, if a spell’s effect only lists “X damage” or “X HP” without a “+”, you don’t use your Spell Power as a base value, but only the listed value and any other applicable modifiers.

> For example, you cast the arcane spell Flickering Flame. You have a d8 for your Mind attribute. First, roll Mind + Arcana vs. the target’s Dodge. On a weak hit, you deal 6 fire damage to them. 4 damage from your Spell Power (1/2 Mind) and “+2 fire damage” from the spell’s effect for a weak success.
> 

### Spell Concentration

Some spells require Concentration to be cast. These spells most often have continuous effects that last for a certain duration. You can only concentrate on one such spell at a time. Each time you take damage while concentrating on a spell, you have to roll Spirit + Fortitude. If you fail this roll, your spell ends immediately. The difficulty of the roll depends on the amount of damage that you took.

| Damage Taken | 5 or less | 6-10 | 11-20 | 21-30 | 31-40 | 41 or more |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Difficulty | Easy (6) | Medium (8) | Hard (10) | Very Hard (12) | Extreme (14) | Legendary (16) |

### Heightening Spells

Some spells allow you to cast them as a higher ranked version to increase their potency at the cost of more Focus. Look at the description of a spell under „Heightened“ to see the changes to the spell‘s effect when doing so.

> Some spells describe heightening effects, such as „deal +4/8/12 damage instead.“ or „inflict burning (2/4/6) instead“. If multiple values are separated by slashes, it refers to the increases effects with better SL. In the first example, the heightened spell would deal +4 damage on a weak success, +8 on a strong success, or +12 on a critical success. The same goes for conditions with multiple values listed.
> 

You can only heighten a spell up to a rank you are capable of casting normally. When heightening a spell to a higher rank, it‘s Focus Cost and Target Difficulty (only if the spell has a static Target Difficulty) are increased according to the following table:

| Heightened Spell Rank | New Focus Cost | New Target Difficulty |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 4 | Medium (8) |
| 3 | 6 | Hard (10) |
| 4 | 8 | Very Hard (12) |
| 5 | 10 | Extreme (14) |

> For example, you have Mysticism at rank 2 and want to cast a heightened version of the rank 1 spell Storm Coat. Because of your Mysticism, you are able to heighten the spell to rank 2. When doing so, the focus cost of the spell is increases to 4 and the TN is increased from moderate (8) to hard (10). On a successful cast, the heightened effect of Storm Coat increases the damage reflected on attackers from +0 to +2 lighting damage.
> 

### Bending Spell Effects

The effects of any given spell describe the most general use case for it. But any crafty spell caster might want to do something with their spells that isn’t directly supported by their effects but would fit within the general description of how the spell acts and works.

In this case, you can attempt to bend the spell’s effect.

> Note, that bending spell effects is different to arcane spell casters ability to alter spells with their Metamagic Arts. Bending spell effects is generally less potent than that.
> 

When doing so, describe your intention with the bend spell effect and how you would accomplish this to the GM. The GM can then decide if this bending effect still fits the general idea of the spell and how it might work within the rules.

As a guide to the GM in deciding, the following rules should always be followed when bending a spell’s effect:

- All creatures able to see you are assumed to understand that you attempt to cast a spell. You may be able to cast a spell stealthily if it only requires a Quick Action, or by imposing +1 bane on casting a non-ritual spell (GM‘s discretion).
- Any spell with a physical effect targeting creatures can also be directed at objects or surfaces.
- Any physical form the spell effect takes or produces vanishes after the spell duration unless the spell specifically states otherwise.
- Any physical substance the spell effect produces provides no nutritious value and can’t be used in place of food or drink unless the spell specifically states otherwise.
- When any spell effect influences the mind or actions of a creature, they are aware that the thoughts or actions are not their own. If they also saw you casting the spell, they are also aware of you being the source of the effect.
- Any spell that targets a location can do so anywhere on the ground, along a wall, or even in the air, provided the physical effect of the spell can reasonably take form at the chosen location (e.g. you can’t make a vine grow in the air without some ground or wall).
- You can treat a rank 0 spell as continuous, provided you aren’t in combat or any other kind of danger.
- You can’t bend the spell’s number of targets.
