# üßù‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Folk

During adventurer creation, choose one of these Folks for your adventurer to be. Each folk also has various cultures, which are home to different regions of the world.

## The Old Folk

The Old Folk consist of those species, that have a cultural history spanning thousands of years. Any of them have been through great achievements, wealth, but also tragedy and catastrophe. 

### Dwarf

Carved of the stone itself, the dwarves have a deep connection to the earth. They are masters of mining and metalworking, and are renowned for their craftsmanship and skill. They value honor and tradition, and their unyielding determination is a testament to their unbreakable bond with the earth.

**Cultures:** Dhurvar (Ice-Dwarves), Ghahar (Gold-Dwarves), Urduk (Grey-Dwarves)

**Dwarven Sight.** You are able to roughly make out differences in temperature by sight. You can see a medium distance in absolute darkness as in dim light. You gain +1 boon on Perception rolls for seeing at melee range, but suffer +1 bane instead at long range or further.

**Stoneskin.** You gain +1 AV.

**Squat Build.** You gain +1 boon on rolls against effects that knock you prone or push you.

### Elf

Living in a spiritual symbiotic state with the life force of nature in their immediate environment, the elves are intimately connected to the natural world. They are sensitive to changes in their surroundings and suffer physically when in barren or lifeless terrain for too long. They are often aloof and unapproachable, but their fierce loyalty to their home and way of life is unwavering.

**Cultures:** Ra‚Äôthep (Sun-Elves), Sylvar (Forest-Elves), Alfir (Shadow-Elves), Ho‚Äôshien (River-Elves)

**Fleet-Footed.** You can choose to gain +1 Movement during your turn. You can use this ability once per combat.

**Spiritual Symbiosis.** You take nourishment from nature around you. While in the wilderness, you only need to sleep for 4 hours each night, allowing you to use the remaining 4 hours for light non-physical activity.

### Gnome

Natural psychics with the ability to read other peoples' intentions and surface thoughts, the gnomes are an open and harmonious culture. However, this often makes them naive when faced with other folk who attempt to deceive them. Their playful nature is a welcome addition to any company.

**Cultures:** Auflin (Willow-Gnomes), Burrin (Den-Gnomes) 

**Natural Empath.** You can read surface thoughts and emotions of any close creature by rolling Spirit + Insight. You can also project your feelings to a creature close to you, allowing you to communicate simple ideas with animals and other creatures. You also intuitively know how many living creatures are close around you and their general direction.

**Scent of Illusions.** You can instinctively make out illusions and invisible things. You gain +1 boon on Spirit rolls to identify magical falsehoods and illusions and impose +1 bane on rolls to fool you with falsehoods or illusions. 

**Small Statue.** You gain +1 boon on Agility rolls to hide or move stealthily. You can only wield versatile weapons two-handed and don‚Äòt add any bonus damage from doing so.

**Stoic Mind.** You gain +1 boon on Spirit rolls against being dazed or frightened.

### Orc

Coming from violent and brutal cultures, the orcs have a reputation for brutality and savagery. While many have adopted a much more civilized life, the Old Folk often reduce them to the evil deeds of their ancestors. Despite this, orcs value strength and honor above all else, and their fierce determination and indomitable wills make them formidable allies.

**Cultures:** Orgon (Island-Orcs), Jinkai (Mountain-Orcs), Gatanka (Jungle-Orcs)

**Orcish Fury.** When you roll a critical success on an attack with a melee weapon, add you weapon damage an additional time to the total damage.

**Pride above Death.** When you would suffer one Wound, you can choose to ignore it. You can use this ability once per day.

## The New Folk

The New Folk are cultures relatively new in the realms. Their more recent ancestors might have lived in barbaric tribes or other societies not capable of speech, craftsmanship, or art.

The Old Folk most often hold superstitions against them, as many view them not worthy of the civilized lands.

**Small Statue.** You gain +1 boon on Agility rolls to hide or move stealthily. You can only wield versatile weapons with two hands and don‚Äòt add any bonus damage from it.

### Human

The newest folk among all the New Folk, humans possess a natural arcane ability that makes many other folk scared of them. Others try to subjugate them to make use of their natural gifts as a weapon. As a result, humans are often caught between fear and exploitation, struggling to find their place in a world that fears their power. But their incredible adaptability and boundless ambition have allowed them to thrive despite these challenges.

### Lionfolk

A proud and regal race, with a deep connection to the natural world and a reverence for the power of the hunt. They are often viewed as noble and honorable, but their fierce pride can make them difficult to work with.
