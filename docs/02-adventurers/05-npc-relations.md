# ðŸ‘¥ NPC Relations

![banner-img](/img/banner/npc-relations-banner.png)

These are the important NPCs that the adventurers have relations with. Each character starts with one of each, allowing the GM to personalize adventurers through their relations. This also gives the adventurers a link to the gaming world and its people.

While the adventurers can take action to gain new allies and contacts, rivals are typically the result of some failure.

## Types of NPC Relations

### Allies

People you have close, personal relationships with. They will help you out with little to no compensation. They will actively act in your best interest.

Types of Allies:

- Mentor
- Merchant
- Adventurer

### Contacts

People you know, have worked or lived with before. More professional than personal relationships. They will do you a favor, but ask for something in return. You can be less sure of their allegiance towards you if their interests donâ€™t align with yours.

### Rivals

People who are opposed to you and your goals. Might be of the same profession as you, or people you crossed, or wronged in your past. They will not help you out unless your goals align absolutely and they gain an advantage from cooperation. They might also attempt to hurt you or destroy your reputation.

## NPC Ranks

Your NPC relations all have a rank. This rank corresponds to the skill rank of abilities the NPC possesses, that are relevant to your relation.

For example, if you have a historian with rank 2 as a contact, they roll with +2 on Education to uncover historical facts for you.

## Gaining new Relations

During the game, you can gain new NPC relations. You might gain a new ally if you assisted them on an adventure, find contacts during downtime, or make a new rival from an enemy that survived during your adventures.

## Changing Relations

Throughout the events of the game, the relation you have with an NPC might also shift. A contact you burn might become a rival, or a rival you make amends with might become a contact.
