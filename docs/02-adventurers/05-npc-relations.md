# ðŸ‘¥ NPCs & Relationships

![banner-img](/img/banner/npc-relations-banner.png)

During your adventures (and also between them) you will meet a variety of Non Player Characters (NPCs) within the world. To keep track of NPCs you build relationships with over time, you can use the following rules.

## NPC Roles

To simplify your interaction with NPCs you have relationships with, each of them will fit into one of the following six roles: Adventurer, Artisan, Authority, Scholar, Scoundrel, or Seeker. These roles describe archetypes with why you will interact with them, and what kind of information or services they can provide you.

### 1. Adventurer

Adventurers are those who live for excitement, danger, and the thrill of exploration or combat. They might be mercenaries, bounty hunters, treasure hunters, outlaws, or wanderers who often take on high-risk tasks. They seek fortune and fame in dangerous places, and their motivations often revolve around personal glory or material gain.

- **Intimate or friendly disposition**
They can offer you valuable knowledge of dangerous areas, lend their combat expertise, and may share spoils equally with you in a tough fight.
- **Indifferent or suspicious disposition**
They may provide a tip or assistance when asked but are mostly uninterested in forging a deeper connection, focusing instead on their own goals.
- **Hostile or hateful disposition**
They might see you as competition and might try to sabotage your efforts, or even steal from you after a hard-won victory.

### 2. Artisan

Artisans are skilled crafters or builders, masters of their trade. They might be blacksmiths, carpenters, weavers, or architects who shape the world with their hands. These NPCs offer practical solutions, craft powerful items, or contribute to the physical development of society.

- **Intimate or friendly disposition**
They can provide you with quality goods at a discount, offer favorable terms, or create well-crafted items that aid you in your quests.
- **Indifferent or suspicious disposition**
They may offer their services without any additional flair, simply fulfilling your needs without emotional investment or forming a deeper connection.
- **Hostile or hateful disposition**
They might refuse to help you, sabotage your equipment, or spread rumors about you out of jealousy or animosity.

### 3. Authority

Authorities hold positions of power, law, or governance. They could be nobles, guards, judges, or anyone who wields social or political influence. These NPCs can open or close doors depending on how the players navigate their political landscape.

- **Intimate or friendly disposition**
They can offer you favors, protection, or access to resources, possibly in exchange for loyalty or service. They may also provide quests that help you gain standing in society.
- **Indifferent or suspicious disposition**
They may ignore you unless you directly need something, offering no help but also no hindrance. Your actions may go unnoticed, or they might treat you as just another citizen.
- **Hostile or hateful disposition**
They might attempt to imprison you, accuse you of crimes, or use their power to impose heavy taxes, restrictions, or punishments, hindering your progress.

### 4. Scholar

Scholars are seekers of knowledgeâ€”whether academic, religious, or medical. They could be priests, healers, historians, or shamans who value study and wisdom above all else. They help uncover mysteries, cure diseases, or provide guidance based on ancient knowledge or lore.

- **Intimate or friendly disposition**
They can offer you valuable knowledge, healing, or insight into mysteries, helping you make critical decisions or understand deeper truths about the world.
- **Indifferent or suspicious disposition**
They may provide minimal advice or healing, focusing more on their own work than on your personal journey. They offer little emotional investment or guidance.
- **Hostile or hateful disposition**
They might dismiss you as ignorant or disruptive, challenge your beliefs, or actively try to obstruct your progress by spreading misinformation or withholding knowledge.

### 5. Scoundrel

Scoundrels are those who thrive in the shadows, relying on trickery, deceit, and manipulation to get what they want. They could be thieves, con artists, spies, or anyone with a hidden agenda. Their goals are usually selfish, and they play by their own rules, regardless of morality.

- **Intimate or friendly disposition**
They can offer you illicit services, such as information or goods, in exchange for a price or your cooperation in their schemes. You might form a mutually beneficial, albeit shady, relationship.
- **Indifferent or suspicious disposition**
They may avoid direct interaction unless thereâ€™s something to gain. They might offer you a deal or service but have little personal interest in you beyond what you can provide.
- **Hostile or hateful disposition**
They might betray or deceive you, frame you for a crime, or steal from you when it suits their goals. They might also sabotage your progress through trickery or blackmail.

### 6. Seeker

Seekers are individuals driven by a questâ€”whether for knowledge, wealth, or personal expression. They might be merchants, guides, entertainers, or anyone seeking something they donâ€™t yet possess. They are often open to new ideas, and their work connects the players to the wider world.

- **Intimate or friendly disposition**
They can offer you useful supplies, guidance, or information in exchange for a shared interest or mutual benefit. Their connections might open doors elsewhere for you.
- **Indifferent or suspicious disposition**
They do their business or provide basic services without much warmth, seeing you as just another customer or traveler. Thereâ€™s little personal investment on their part.
- **Hostile or hateful disposition**
They might deceive or overcharge you, withhold information, or act out of selfishness or greed, hindering your progress when it suits them.

## Disposition

Each NPC an adventurer has a relationship with will have one of the following six disposition levels. Through various events, adventures, or other interactions in the game world, the disposition level of a NPC can change over time. For example, when you fulfill a major favor for an NPC, their disposition level might improve by one step. If you anger or wrong them however, it might reduce by one step instead.

1. **Hateful** **-3**
Actively hates the adventurer, wont be convinced otherwise, and will proactively attempt to hinder them.
2. **Hostile -2** 
Opposes the adventurerâ€˜s goals and is very hard to be convinced otherwise.
3. **Suspicious -1** 
Doesnâ€˜t trust the adventurer, but can be convinced otherwise for the right reward.
4. **Indifferent +0** 
Has no strong opinion of the adventurer and will assist them transactionally.
5. **Friendly +1** 
Has a good opinion of the adventurer and is happy to help them.
6. **Intimate** **+2** 
Has a very close relationship to the adventurer, such as treating them as a family member, close friend, or even lover. They will most likely support the adventurer, no questions asked.

### First Reactions

New NPCs you meet for the first time will have different default disposition levels, based on the circumstances under which you meet.
For example, a fellow patron in an inn might start being indifferent to you, or even friendly if you invite them on a drink. On the other hand, a guard catching you in an alleyway might be suspicious of you or even outright hostile if you enter a restricted area.

This also applies to any NPCs or other creatures you meet during an adventure, where it is up to the GM to determine how that an individual or group first reacts to the adventurers. The GM can also roll on the following table to determine their first reaction randomly:

| 2d6 | Reaction |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | **Hateful (-3).** Immediately springing into action, leading to fight or flight. |
| 3-5 | **Hostile (-2).** Aggressive or startled. Threatening, preparing to fight, or just snarling. |
| 6-8 | **Suspicious (-1).** Uncertain or confused. Just hearing, waiting, or looking around and considering their options. |
| 9-11 | **Indifferent (0).** Interested or curious. They will approach, smell first, or ask questions. |
| 12 | **Friendly (+1).** Instantly friendly or favorable. Will try to bargain or make alliances. |

### NPC disposition levels during Interaction

Whenever you have to roll for socially interacting with an NPC, apply the positive or negative modifier to the Difficulty of that test.

Keep in mind that no NPC, regardless of their good disposition towards you, is happy to be exploited. A favor will always have to be returned at some point and the generosity of friendly or intimate NPCs is not endless. Overreaching what you can ask of an NPC may also lead to lowering their disposition towards you.

> For example, you ask a friendly NPC a small favor. Normally, the difficulty would be medium (TN 8). But because of their friendly disposition, the Difficulty is reduced to easy (TN 6).
Would you instead ask a hostile NPC, the Difficulty will be increased by two steps to very hard (TN 12). Keep in mind, that even being able to attempt such as roll will require you to provide that NPC a very good reason to help you despite their disposition (such as a common enemy). And even if you succeed, they will only assist you begrudgingly.
