# 👥 NPCs and Relationships

![banner-img](/img/banner/npc-relations-banner.png)

> "In the weaving of destinies, the threads we form with others determine the pattern of our fate. A single ally in the shifting sands can mean the difference between perishing beneath the merciless sun or finding the hidden oasis."

During your adventures across the lands of Atakhet and beyond you will encounter numerous inhabitants who breathe life into this world. To track meaningful relationships with Non-Player Characters (NPCs), use the following guidelines.

## NPC Roles

Each significant NPC you develop a relationship with falls into one of six archetypal roles. These roles define their function in society, their motivations, and what resources or assistance they might provide to adventurers.

### **1. Adventurer**

Adventurers are those who live for excitement, danger, and the thrill of exploration or combat. They might be mercenaries, bounty hunters, treasure hunters, outlaws, or wanderers who often take on high-risk tasks. They seek fortune and fame in dangerous places, and their motivations often revolve around personal glory or material gain.

- **Intimate or friendly disposition** They can offer you valuable knowledge of dangerous areas, lend their combat expertise, and may share spoils equally with you in a tough fight.
- **Indifferent or suspicious disposition** They may provide a tip or assistance when asked but are mostly uninterested in forging a deeper connection, focusing instead on their own goals.
- **Hostile or hateful disposition** They might see you as competition and might try to sabotage your efforts, or even steal from you after a hard-won victory.

### **2. Artisan**

Artisans are skilled crafters or builders, masters of their trade. They might be blacksmiths, carpenters, weavers, or architects who shape the world with their hands. These NPCs offer practical solutions, craft powerful items, or contribute to the physical development of society.

- **Intimate or friendly disposition** They can provide you with quality goods at a discount, offer favorable terms, or create well-crafted items that aid you in your quests.
- **Indifferent or suspicious disposition** They may offer their services without any additional flair, simply fulfilling your needs without emotional investment or forming a deeper connection.
- **Hostile or hateful disposition** They might refuse to help you, sabotage your equipment, or spread rumors about you out of jealousy or animosity.

### **3. Authority**

Authorities hold positions of power, law, or governance. They could be nobles, guards, judges, or anyone who wields social or political influence. These NPCs can open or close doors depending on how the players navigate their political landscape.

- **Intimate or friendly disposition** They can offer you favors, protection, or access to resources, possibly in exchange for loyalty or service. They may also provide quests that help you gain standing in society.
- **Indifferent or suspicious disposition** They may ignore you unless you directly need something, offering no help but also no hindrance. Your actions may go unnoticed, or they might treat you as just another citizen.
- **Hostile or hateful disposition** They might attempt to imprison you, accuse you of crimes, or use their power to impose heavy taxes, restrictions, or punishments, hindering your progress.

### **4. Scholar**

Scholars are seekers of knowledge—whether academic, religious, or medical. They could be priests, healers, historians, or shamans who value study and wisdom above all else. They help uncover mysteries, cure diseases, or provide guidance based on ancient knowledge or lore.

- **Intimate or friendly disposition** They can offer you valuable knowledge, healing, or insight into mysteries, helping you make critical decisions or understand deeper truths about the world.
- **Indifferent or suspicious disposition** They may provide minimal advice or healing, focusing more on their own work than on your personal journey. They offer little emotional investment or guidance.
- **Hostile or hateful disposition** They might dismiss you as ignorant or disruptive, challenge your beliefs, or actively try to obstruct your progress by spreading misinformation or withholding knowledge.

### **5. Scoundrel**

Scoundrels are those who thrive in the shadows, relying on trickery, deceit, and manipulation to get what they want. They could be thieves, con artists, spies, or anyone with a hidden agenda. Their goals are usually selfish, and they play by their own rules, regardless of morality.

- **Intimate or friendly disposition** They can offer you illicit services, such as information or goods, in exchange for a price or your cooperation in their schemes. You might form a mutually beneficial, albeit shady, relationship.
- **Indifferent or suspicious disposition** They may avoid direct interaction unless there’s something to gain. They might offer you a deal or service but have little personal interest in you beyond what you can provide.
- **Hostile or hateful disposition** They might betray or deceive you, frame you for a crime, or steal from you when it suits their goals. They might also sabotage your progress through trickery or blackmail.

### **6. Seeker**

Seekers are individuals driven by a quest—whether for knowledge, wealth, or personal expression. They might be merchants, guides, entertainers, or anyone seeking something they don’t yet possess. They are often open to new ideas, and their work connects the players to the wider world.

- **Intimate or friendly disposition** They can offer you useful supplies, guidance, or information in exchange for a shared interest or mutual benefit. Their connections might open doors elsewhere for you.
- **Indifferent or suspicious disposition** They do their business or provide basic services without much warmth, seeing you as just another customer or traveler. There’s little personal investment on their part.
- **Hostile or hateful disposition** They might deceive or overcharge you, withhold information, or act out of selfishness or greed, hindering your progress when it suits them.

## Disposition

Each relationship with an NPC is measured by their disposition toward your adventurers. This disposition can shift over time based on your actions, favors exchanged, or promises kept or broken. When you fulfill a major quest for an NPC, their disposition might improve; when you betray their trust, it might deteriorate.

| Level | Disposition | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -3 | **Hateful** | Actively despises the adventurer and will work to undermine them even at personal cost. |
| -2 | **Hostile** | Opposes the adventurer's goals and requires significant persuasion or leverage to cooperate. |
| -1 | **Suspicious** | Distrusts the adventurer but may be convinced to assist for appropriate compensation. |
| +0 | **Indifferent** | Has no strong feelings toward the adventurer and interacts purely transactionally. |
| +1 | **Friendly** | Views the adventurer favorably and is willing to offer modest assistance or discount. |
| +2 | **Intimate** | Considers the adventurer as family, close friend, or honored ally and offers substantial support. |

### First Reactions

When encountering new NPCs, their initial disposition varies based on circumstances, local customs, and cultural factors. A merchant in a river delta trading post might start as indifferent or even friendly if you appear prosperous. A temple guardian might be suspicious or hostile if you approach restricted areas without proper offerings or permissions.

The GM determines initial reactions based on context or may roll randomly using the table below:

| 2d6 | Reaction |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | **Hateful (-3).** Immediately hostile, may attack on sight or call for guards. |
| 3-5 | **Hostile (-2).** Aggressive or alarmed, making threats or preparing defensive measures. |
| 6-8 | **Suspicious (-1).** Wary and guarded, assessing potential threat or opportunity. |
| 9-11 | **Indifferent (0).** Curious or businesslike, willing to interact without emotional investment. |
| 12 | **Friendly (+1).** Welcoming and helpful, predisposed to view the adventurers positively. |

### NPC Interactions and Tests

When making social interaction tests with NPCs, apply their disposition modifier to the Difficulty of your test. Adjust the Difficulty a number of steps equal to the NPCs disposition level (positive dispositions reduce the Difficulty, negative dispositions increase it).

> Example: Sephi the Seer needs information about ancient temple ruins from a local scholar. The scholar is friendly toward Sephi due to their shared respect for knowledge. Normally, extracting this specific information would be a medium Difficulty Influence test (TN 8), but the scholar's friendly disposition reduces the Difficulty by one step to easy (TN 6). Sephi rolls their Mind (d8) + Influence (d6), needing only a 6 to succeed.
> Later, Sephi approaches a hostile temple guardian to gain entry to a restricted archive. The base difficulty would be Medium (TN 8), but the guardian's hostile disposition increases it by two steps to Very Hard (TN 12). Even with Sephi's Mind (d8) + Influence (d6), this will be a challenging test.

Remember that even the most favorable NPCs will not endlessly provide assistance without reciprocation. Relationships require maintenance—favors must be returned, respect must be shown, and cultural protocols must be observed. Repeatedly exploiting an NPC's goodwill can turn even an intimate ally into a suspicious acquaintance or worse.

## Building Your Network

As you journey through the lands of Atakhet and beyond, building a diverse network of relationships becomes as valuable as any treasure. A skilled adventuring party might cultivate allies across different roles and regions, for example:

- An **Adventurer** guide who knows hidden water sources in the desert
- An **Artisan** weaponsmith in the capital city who crafts specialized tools
- An **Authority** figure within the river delta traders' guild who provides travel permits
- A **Scholar** in a mountain temple who can translate ancient hieroglyphs
- A **Scoundrel** in the jungle frontier who smuggles rare ingredients
- A **Seeker** merchant whose caravans carry messages across the realm

Each relationship opens new possibilities, provides unique advantages, and creates story opportunities. The adventurers should track these relationships and use them to enrich the campaign world, creating a living network that responds to your actions and choices throughout your adventures.
