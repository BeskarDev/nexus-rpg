![banner-img](/img/banner/languages-banner.png)

> "Words are the rivers that connect our minds, yet each tongue flows differently through the lands. Learn them well, for to speak in another's language is to glimpse the world through their eyes."
> 

You can learn to speak, write, and read various languages throughout the known worldâ€”from the common tongues used in bustling trade cities to ancient and forgotten scripts found in crumbling ruins beneath the sands.

Adventurers learn additional languages depending on their Mind attribute or through talents acquired during their journeys.

| Mind | Extra Languages |
| --- | --- |
| d4 | none |
| d6 | none |
| d8 | one |
| d10 | two |
| d12 | three |

## Common Languages

Common languages are those spoken by larger cultures throughout the realms. All characters are assumed to speak and understand **Tradespeak**, a universal language used by merchants and travelers across different lands, unless they come from highly isolated communities.

| Language | Example Speakers |
| --- | --- |
| Catspeech | catfolk |
| Dwarvish | dwarves |
| Elvish | elves |
| Giant | hunes, minotaurs, giants |
| Gnomish | hnomes |
| Goblin | goblinoids |
| Lizardspeech | lizardfolk |
| Orc | orcs |
| Tradespeak | merchants, travelers, humans |

> Example: Nagkhan the Sorcerer has a Mind attribute of d8, allowing them to learn one additional language beyond their native languages. They choose to learn Dark Tongue to study forbidden texts of arcane secrets.

## Ancient Languages

These languages are mainly spoken by ancient, immortal, or long forgotten beings. Mortals can learn these languages to better communicate with their godsâ€™ messengers or other powerful creatures within the world.

| Language | Example Speakers |
| --- | --- |
| Draconic | dragons |
| Primordial | elementals |
| Celestial | gods, extraplanar beings |
| Dark Tongue | arcane cultists, elder horrors |
