## Design Principles

All items in this analysis follow a strict design constraint: **no direct statistical bonuses**. Items should not grant flat numerical increases to AV, Parry, Dodge, Resist, attributes, damage, or similar values — those rewards are reserved for magical equipment (Q4+).

Non-magical items instead provide:

| Approach | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Circumstantial advantage** | +1 boon on a narrow category of rolls under specific conditions | Spiked gauntlets grant +1 boon to resist being disarmed |
| **Circumstantial penalty for opponents** | +1 bane imposed on enemies in specific situations | Caltrops impose +1 bane on movement through an area |
| **Novel mechanical option** | Enables an action or tactic not otherwise available | Grappling hook allows climbing without a suitable surface |
| **Narrative utility** | Provides non-combat fictional positioning or problem-solving | Signal whistle communicates across long range |
| **Consumable trade-off** | One-time use with a strong but bounded effect | Flash powder briefly blinds nearby creatures |

> **Guiding rule:** If a magic enchantment already provides an effect (e.g., "of Protection" for AV, "of Fast Stride" for movement), a mundane item must **not** replicate that effect. Mundane items should complement magic, not compete with it.

## 1. Equipment Slot Items (Non-Magical)

Currently only the Body slot has mundane options (Clothes). All other slots are empty until magic items are acquired. The items below fill that gap with flavorful, non-statistical gear.

## 2. Classic Adventuring Gear

These items fill gaps in the existing Gear category with classic fantasy adventure staples.

### Missing Staples

| Quality | Name | Load | Cost | Proposed Effect |
|---------|------|------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Chalk (bundle) | 0 | 5 | Mark walls, floors, or objects to leave trails, messages, or symbols. Already in Adventuring Gear toolkit, but useful as a standalone purchase. |

## 3. Alchemical Substances — New Entries

The existing alchemy list covers healing, damage poisons, fire/smoke bombs, and the heightening potion. The following fill remaining niches.

### Sensory & Disruption Alchemicals

| Quality | Name | Load | Cost | Proposed Effect |
|---------|------|------|------|-----------------|
| 2 | Flash Powder | 1 | 30 | As an Action, throw at a point within close range. Each creature within melee range of the point must roll Spirit + Fortitude vs. TN 8 or be blinded until the end of their next turn. Spend 1 use per deployment. |

Creatures starting their turn in the cloud must roll Strength + Fortitude vs. TN 8 or become poisoned until the end of their next turn. |
| 2 | Glue Pot | 1 | 50 | As an Action, pour or throw at a melee-range area. The area becomes difficult terrain for a short duration. A creature that starts its turn in the area must roll Strength + Athletics vs. TN 8 or become slowed until the end of its next turn. Spend 1 use per deployment. |
| 2 | Luminous Paste | 1 | 30 | Apply to a surface or creature as an Action. The target emits dim light in close range for a medium duration. Invisible creatures marked this way have their position revealed. Cannot be easily wiped off. Spend 1 use per application. |

### Enhancement & Utility Alchemicals

| Quality | Name | Load | Cost | Proposed Effect |
|---------|------|------|------|-----------------|
| 2 | Smelling Salts | 0 | 25 | As an Action, administer to an unconscious creature within melee range. The target immediately wakes up (this does not restore HP or heal Wounds, and does not work if the creature is at 0 HP). Spend 1 use per application. |
| 2 | Cooling Salve | 1 | 30 | As an Action, apply to a creature suffering from the burning condition. The burning condition is immediately removed. Spend 1 use per application. |

| 3 | Bottled Tar | 1 | 125 | Counts as a thrown weapon (bundle (d4), thrown (short)). Covers a close area in sticky black tar. The area becomes difficult terrain for a medium duration. Any creature in the area when an open flame is applied to it takes 4 fire damage (ignoring AV) and the tar burns for a short duration, dealing 2 fire damage (ignoring AV) to creatures starting their turn in the area. |
| 3 | Alchemist's Solvent | 1 | 125 | As an Action, apply to a surface or creature. Dissolves most mundane adhesives, resins, and non-magical bindings on contact. Can free a creature from a mundane net, glue, or web (but not magical entanglement). Spend 1 use per application. |
| 3 | Night-Eye Drops | 1 | 125 | As an Action, apply to your own eyes. For a medium duration, you can see in dim light as if it were bright light. You suffer +1 bane on Perception rolls while in bright light for the same duration. Spend 1 use per application. |
| 3 | Ironblood Draught | 1 | 125 | Drink as an Action. For a short duration, you gain +1 boon on Fortitude rolls against bleeding and poison effects. After the duration ends, roll Strength + Fortitude vs. TN 8 or suffer 1 Fatigue. Spend 1 use after drinking. |

## 5. Integration Recommendations

### Pricing & Quality Guidelines

- **Q1 items (5–25 coins):** Commonly available in any settlement. Simple materials, easy to improvise. These are the items every adventurer picks up at character creation or in the first village.
- **Q2 items (25–75 coins):** Available in towns and trade hubs. Represent gear made by skilled artisans. This is the sweet spot for rewarding early-game exploration and smart purchasing.
- **Q3 items (125+ coins):** Found in cities, specialty shops, or as minor loot from defeated enemies. Represent expert craftsmanship and rare materials. Good minor treasure for levels 1–4.

### Reward Distribution

| Scenario | Recommended Items |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Starting gear** | Straw hat, sandals, work gloves, rope belt, oilskin cloak, chalk, ball of twine |
| **First dungeon loot** | Iron spikes, caltrops, mirror, manacles, flash powder |
| **Wilderness exploration** | Grappling hook, camouflage cloak, climbing shoes, bearing compass, fishing kit |
| **Urban adventure** | Hollow ring, signet ring, disguise kit, cloth hood, locksmith's bracers |
| **Enemy loot (bandits, soldiers)** | Spiked gauntlets, sturdy boots, bear trap, manacles, tripwire kit |
| **Merchant/shop purchase** | Tool belt, bandolier, spyglass, night-eye drops, alchemist's solvent |
| **Alchemist NPC** | Any new alchemicals — prices serve as the baseline |

### How Non-Magical Gear Complements Magic Items

Non-magical slot items serve three purposes in the overall item economy:

1. **Early-game placeholder**: Characters have something meaningful in each slot before acquiring magic items. When a magic item is found, the mundane item is retired — creating a satisfying upgrade moment.
2. **Side-grade options**: Some mundane items (e.g., camouflage cloak, tool belt) offer effects that no existing enchantment provides. Characters may keep these even after acquiring other magic items if they value the unique effect.
3. **Thematic expression**: A rogue's cloth hood, a ranger's climbing shoes, or a scholar's artisan's loupe give characters identity through equipment before magic enters the picture.

### Crafting & Harvesting Tie-Ins

- **Crafting mundane slot items**: Characters with Crafting skill and appropriate toolkits can create Q1–Q3 mundane equipment during downtime. The materials are common and the cost is straightforward.
- **Improvised versions**: GMs can allow improvised versions of many items (e.g., making caltrops from scrap metal, fashioning a face wrap from cloth) that function for one use or one scene.
- **Alchemical crafting**: New alchemicals follow the existing system — Alchemist's Supplies + base ingredients + a Crafting roll during downtime.

## 6. Design Cautions

| Caution | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| **No flat stat bonuses** | Mundane items must not grant +X to AV, Parry, Dodge, Resist, attributes, or weapon damage. That design space belongs to Q4+ magic items. |
| **Boons, not bonuses** | When granting advantages, use "+1 boon on [narrow roll category]" rather than numerical bonuses. Boons are bounded and don't stack in the same way. |
| **Narrow triggers** | Each item's benefit should apply to a specific, identifiable situation — not broadly. A camouflage cloak helps Stealth in one terrain while motionless, not all Stealth everywhere. |
| **Don't duplicate enchantments** | Cross-reference the enchantments list before finalizing any item. If "of Resistance (frost)" exists, a mundane item should not grant frost resistance. |
| **Load matters** | Q1–Q2 worn items should be 0 load while worn. Heavier gear items at 1–2 load create meaningful carry-capacity trade-offs. |
| **Consumable balance** | New alchemicals should not outperform existing ones at the same Quality. Flash powder (Q2, 30 coins) blinds briefly and costs the same as an Acid Vial — comparable power for different purposes. |

## 7. Summary & Next Steps

### Coverage Summary

| Area | Items Proposed | Priority |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Equipment slot items | 27 | **High** — fills an empty design space for all non-Body slots |
| Classic adventuring gear | 16 | **High** — staple dungeon/exploration items missing from the current list |
| Alchemical substances | 11 | **Medium** — expands options for alchemist characters and loot tables |
| Trap/tactical items | 3 | **Medium** — enables new combat and exploration tactics |

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Review & prioritize** — Select a first batch (15–20 items) for immediate implementation.
2. **Write full item entries** — Convert proposals into final format matching existing gear/alchemy tables.
3. **Playtest edge cases** — Test items like caltrops, bear traps, and flash powder in combat to validate difficulty numbers and action costs.
4. **Update loot tables** — Integrate new items into treasure generation for appropriate tiers.
5. **Add slot items to equipment page** — Consider a new "Apparel" or "Wearables" equipment subcategory for non-armor slot items.

*This analysis identifies 57 new non-magical items spanning all 8 equipment slots, classic adventuring gear, alchemical substances, and tactical equipment. All proposals follow the principle of circumstantial advantage over statistical bonuses, complementing the existing magic item system rather than competing with it.*
