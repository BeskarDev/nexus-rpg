## Setting Note

Nexus RPG is set in a Bronze Age sword-and-sorcery world inspired by ancient civilizations — Mesopotamia, Egypt, Persia, the Levant, the Indus Valley, and early Aegean cultures. All items in this analysis must fit that aesthetic. Avoid references to technologies, terms, or tools that post-date the Bronze Age:

- **No magnetic compasses** (invented ~200 BCE, common in medieval period) → use celestial navigation tools
- **No glass lenses / spyglasses** (precision optical lenses emerged in 13th century CE) → use polished stone or metal reflectors, sighting rods, or natural crystal magnifiers
- **No gunpowder-derived substances** → use mineral dusts, natural resins, and plant-derived preparations
- **Language**: prefer "tomb," "ruin," "catacomb," or "labyrinth" over "dungeon"; "citadel" or "ziggurat" over "castle"; "city-state" over "kingdom"

## Design Principles

All items in this analysis follow a strict design constraint: **no direct statistical bonuses**. Items should not grant flat numerical increases to AV, Parry, Dodge, Resist, attributes, damage, or similar values — those rewards are reserved for magical equipment (Q4+).

Non-magical items instead provide:

| Approach | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Circumstantial advantage** | +1 boon on a narrow category of rolls under specific conditions | Bronze-studded gauntlets grant +1 boon to resist being disarmed |
| **Circumstantial penalty for opponents** | +1 bane imposed on enemies in specific situations | Caltrops impose +1 bane on movement through an area |
| **Novel mechanical option** | Enables an action or tactic not otherwise available | Grappling hook allows climbing without a suitable surface |
| **Narrative utility** | Provides non-combat fictional positioning or problem-solving | Reed signal horn communicates across long range |
| **Consumable trade-off** | One-time use with a strong but bounded effect | Blinding dust briefly blinds nearby creatures |

> **Guiding rule:** If a magic enchantment already provides an effect (e.g., "of Protection" for AV, "of Fast Stride" for movement), a mundane item must **not** replicate that effect. Mundane items should complement magic, not compete with it.

## 1. Equipment Slot Items (Non-Magical)

## 2. Classic Adventuring Gear

These items fill gaps in the existing Gear category. All descriptions draw on materials and technologies consistent with the Bronze Age and ancient world — bronze, bone, clay, pitch, flax, papyrus, and basic fired ceramics.

### Missing Staples

| Quality | Name | Load | Cost | Proposed Effect |
|---------|------|------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Chalk / Ochre Stick | 0 | 5 | A stick of chalk or red ochre. Mark walls, tomb passages, or objects to leave trails, symbols, or warnings. Easily acquired but useful as a standalone purchase beyond the Adventuring Gear toolkit. |
| 1 | Bronze Spikes (bundle, d6) | 1 | 10 | Short bronze pegs. Drive into stone or wood to jam doors, create hand-holds for climbing, or anchor ropes. Spend 1 use per spike deployed. |
| 1 | Caltrops | 1 | 15 | Small bronze or bone devices with multiple points. Scatter across a close area as an Action. Creatures moving through the area for the first time on a turn must roll Agility + Perception vs. TN 8 or take 2 physical damage (ignoring AV) and become slowed until the end of their next turn. Spend 1 use per deployment. |
| 1 | Ball of Twine | 0 | 5 | Spun plant fiber that covers a long distance. Used to mark paths through ruins and labyrinths, set tripwires, or measure distances. |
| 1 | Wooden Pole (10 ft) | 1 | 5 | A long staff of hardwood. Useful for probing pit traps and unstable floors, bridging narrow gaps, or extending reach. Can be used as an improvised weapon (as staff). |
| 1 | Fishing Kit | 1 | 10 | A bone fishhook, plant-fiber line, and a split-reed float. You can attempt to catch fish during a rest near water. Roll Agility + Survival; on a success, gain enough food for one person for the day. |

| 1 | Clay Tablet & Stylus | 0 | 10 | A small unfired clay slab and a sharpened reed stylus. Can record written information — maps, messages, cipher text, or copied inscriptions. Text can be made permanent by firing the tablet. Spend 1 use per tablet filled. |
| 1 | Beeswax Block | 0 | 10 | A block of pure beeswax. Waterproofs leather goods, silences creaking armor joints, seals clay surfaces, or functions as a re-usable writing surface (press in text with a stylus, smooth to reset). Spend 1 use per application. |
| 1 | Animal Bladder Float | 0 | 15 | An inflated and sealed animal bladder. Provides enough buoyancy to keep a character's head and upper body above water. You may attempt to cross calm water without a roll; rough or fast-moving water still requires an Athletics check. |
| 1 | Tallow Candles (bundle, d6) | 1 | 10 | Rendered animal-fat candles set in small clay holders. Each candle provides dim light in melee range and burns for roughly one hour. Spend 1 use per candle burned. Far cheaper than lantern oil but far weaker in range. |
| 1 | Bitumen Torch Bundle (d6) | 1 | 10 | Simple wooden torches dipped in bitumen pitch. Each torch burns for a short duration, providing bright light in melee range and dim light in close range. More portable than a lantern. Spend 1 use per torch lit. |
| 1 | Sinew Cord | 0 | 20 | A close-distance length of dried animal sinew. Stronger than hemp rope and resists cutting with a standard blade, but stiffens after soaking in water. Used to lash, bind, or replace a broken bowstring. Spend 1 use to replace a snapped bowstring as a Quick Action. |
| 1 | Spare Bowstring | 0 | 15 | A fresh length of twisted plant fiber or animal sinew, coiled and stored in a small pouch. Allows replacing a snapped bowstring as a Quick Action (rather than a full Action and a Crafting roll). |
| 1 | Papyrus Roll | 0 | 15 | A quality roll of papyrus, enough for a detailed map or a lengthy written record. Required for certain Education or Lore tasks that produce written documents. Spend 1 use per significant record or document produced. |
| 2 | Grappling Hook | 1 | 50 | A bronze hook with multiple prongs. Attach to a rope and throw it at close range to anchor onto ledges, walls, or overhangs. Roll Agility + Athletics to hook a target; on a failure, the hook doesn't catch (but can be retried). |
| 2 | Bronze Hand Mirror | 0 | 30 | A polished disc of bronze in a handle of bone or hardwood. Look around corners or over walls without exposing yourself. Can reflect sunlight to signal allies at long range. |
| 2 | Shackles | 1 | 50 | Bronze or iron shackles for restraining a captive. A restrained creature must succeed on a hard Strength + Athletics or Agility + Stealth test to escape. A key is included; can also be opened with thieves' tools (hard difficulty). |
| 2 | Water Clock (small) | 0 | 50 | A small clay vessel with a calibrated hole through which water drips into a lower vessel. Measures roughly 10 minutes per fill. Useful for timing rituals, alchemical processes, or guard rotations. |
| 2 | Sighting Rod | 1 | 75 | A notched bronze rod used by ancient surveyors and hunters to gauge distance and trajectory. You can make Perception rolls to judge distances and spot details at long range without penalty. |
| 2 | Chains (short) | 1 | 50 | A short length of bronze or iron links (close distance). Stronger than rope and cannot be cut with a normal blade. Used to bind, anchor, or secure heavy loads. |
| 2 | Star Chart | 0 | 50 | A clay tablet or sheet of papyrus inscribed with the principal constellations and their seasonal movements, produced by temple astronomers. You gain +1 boon on Survival or Nature rolls to navigate at night or determine the season. Does not function underground or in conditions of total cloud cover. |
| 2 | Obsidian Surgeon's Blade | 0 | 50 | A razor-thin flake of volcanic obsidian, among the sharpest natural edges known. When using a Healer's Kit to treat a Wound, you gain +1 boon on the Spirit/Mind + Nature roll. Extremely fragile — on a blunder, the blade shatters (d4 Durability; lost on a blunder). |
| 2 | Bronze Bell | 0 | 30 | A small handcast bronze bell with a clear tone carrying to long range outdoors. Can be hung on a tripwire as a camp alarm. When rung within close range, animals and creatures with keen hearing must roll Spirit + Fortitude vs. TN 8 or be startled and lose their next Quick Action. |
| 2 | Ox Hide Tent | 2 | 75 | A large shelter of treated ox hide stretched over wooden poles. Provides comfortable shelter for up to 4 people. While sheltered in this tent during a night's rest, each occupant gains +1 boon on Fortitude rolls to recover from illness or exhaustion. |
| 3 | Sectional Measuring Rod | 1 | 125 | A surveyor's rod of jointed hardwood sections bound with rawhide, collapsing to half its length for transport. Functions as a normal 10 ft pole but takes up only 0 load when collapsed. |

### Trap & Tactical Items

| Quality | Name | Load | Cost | Proposed Effect |
|---------|------|------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Net (thrown) | 1 | 15 | Counts as a thrown weapon (thrown (close/short)). On a hit against a large or smaller creature, the target is grappled. The target can use an Action to roll Strength + Athletics vs. TN 8 to break free, or can be cut free (the net has d4 Durability and 1 use before being destroyed). |
| 1 | Flour Alarm | 0 | 10 | A pouch of finely milled grain powder or white chalk dust. Spread across a doorway, floor section, or corridor as an Action. Any invisible creature moving through the area is revealed by the clinging dust. Any creature passing through leaves visible tracks, allowing Survival rolls to reconstruct their path. Spend 1 use per deployment. |
| 1 | Crockery Alarm | 1 | 10 | Several clay pot sherds strung on a cord. Rig across a passage as an Action. When disturbed, it creates a loud clattering noise audible at long range. Creatures in or adjacent to the passage must roll Agility + Stealth vs. TN 9 to avoid giving away their presence. Detectable with a hard Perception roll. |
| 2 | Iron-Jaw Snare | 2 | 50 | A hinged bronze or iron trap with toothed jaws. Takes an Action to set in a melee-range area. The first large or smaller creature to enter the area is grappled and takes 4 physical damage (ignoring AV). Escaping requires a hard Strength + Athletics roll. Spend 1 use when triggered. |
| 2 | Tripwire Kit | 1 | 50 | A spool of cord and bronze anchor pegs. Spend 1 use and an Action to rig a tripwire across a doorway or narrow passage (up to close distance wide). The first creature to move through it without awareness must roll Agility + Perception vs. TN 8 or be knocked prone. A hard Perception roll detects the wire before triggering it. |
| 2 | Smoke Signal Kit | 1 | 50 | Damp greenwood chips and pitch-soaked rags in a sealed clay vessel. Igniting the kit (an Action) produces a column of dense colored smoke visible at extreme range on a clear day, lasting a short duration. Can transmit simple pre-arranged signals (up to 3 distinct plumes). Spend 1 use per signal. |

## 3. Alchemical Substances — New Entries

The existing alchemy list covers healing, weapon poisons, fire/smoke bombs, and the heightening potion. The following fill remaining niches.

### Sensory & Disruption Alchemicals

| 3 | Natron Solvent | 1 | 125 | A strong preparation of natron salts dissolved in water and mixed with acetic vinegar, used by embalmers and dye-workers.

| 3 | Cat's-Eye Oil | 1 | 125 | A preparation of diluted belladonna and other night-vision herbs, known to healers and night-hunters. As an Action, apply a drop to each eye.

| 3 | Ironblood Draught | 1 | 125 | A bitter tincture of iron-rich river clay, astringent bark, and coagulating plant compounds. Drink as an Action.

Spend 1 use after drinking. |

## 5. Integration Recommendations

### Pricing & Quality Guidelines

- **Q1 items (5–25 coins):** Commonly available in any settlement — villages, way-stations, river markets. Simple materials easy to improvise. These are the items every adventurer picks up at character creation or in the first settlement.
- **Q2 items (25–75 coins):** Available in towns, city-state bazaars, and trade caravans. Represent gear made by skilled craftspeople. This is the sweet spot for rewarding early exploration and smart purchasing.
- **Q3 items (125+ coins):** Found in major city-states, temple precincts, or specialized merchants. Represent expert craftsmanship and uncommon materials. Good minor treasure for levels 1–4.

### Reward Distribution

| Scenario | Recommended Items |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Starting gear** | Reed sun hat, reed sandals, laborer's wraps, cord belt, waxed wool cloak, chalk/ochre stick, ball of twine, woad war paint |
| **First tomb or ruin** | Bronze spikes, caltrops, bronze hand mirror, shackles, blinding dust, flour alarm, tallow candles |
| **Wilderness or steppe travel** | Grappling hook, hunter's shroud, climbing shoes, star chart, fishing kit, tracker's moccasins |
| **Urban intrigue** | Hollow ring, signet ring, vial harness, linen hood, tumblersmith's bracers, trade seal ring |
| **Enemy loot (raiders, soldiers)** | Bronze-studded gauntlets, reinforced sandals, iron-jaw snare, shackles, tripwire kit, warrior's girdle |
| **Merchant or caravan purchase** | Craftsman's belt, vial harness, sighting rod, cat's-eye oil, natron solvent, ox hide tent |
| **Temple or priest NPC** | Sacred incense bundle, herbalist's amulet, ivory gorget, carnelian ward, clay tablet & stylus |
| **Alchemist or apothecary NPC** | Any new alchemicals — prices serve as the baseline for trade |

### How Non-Magical Gear Complements Magic Items

Non-magical slot items serve three purposes in the overall item economy:

1. **Early-game placeholder**: Characters have something meaningful in each slot before acquiring magic items. When a magic item is found, the mundane item is retired — creating a satisfying upgrade moment.
2. **Side-grade options**: Some mundane items (e.g., hunter's shroud, craftsman's belt) offer effects that no existing enchantment provides. Characters may keep these even after acquiring other magic items if they value the unique effect.
3. **Thematic expression**: A rogue's linen hood, a ranger's climbing shoes, or a scholar's crystal lens circlet give characters identity through equipment before magic enters the picture.

### Crafting & Harvesting Tie-Ins

- **Crafting mundane slot items**: Characters with the Crafting skill and appropriate toolkits can create Q1–Q3 mundane equipment during downtime. Materials are common and costs are straightforward.
- **Improvised versions**: GMs can allow improvised versions of many items (e.g., shaping bronze scraps into caltrops, wrapping cloth as a face covering) that function for one use or one scene.
- **Alchemical crafting**: New alchemicals follow the existing system — Alchemist's Supplies + base ingredients + a Crafting roll during downtime. Ancient world ingredients (natron, bitumen pitch, plant resins) are available as trade goods.

## 6. Design Cautions

| Caution | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| **No flat stat bonuses** | Mundane items must not grant +X to AV, Parry, Dodge, Resist, attributes, or weapon damage. That design space belongs to Q4+ magic items. |
| **Boons, not bonuses** | When granting advantages, use "+1 boon on [narrow roll category]" rather than numerical bonuses. Boons are bounded and don't stack in the same way. |
| **Narrow triggers** | Each item's benefit should apply to a specific, identifiable situation — not broadly. A hunter's shroud helps Stealth in one terrain type while motionless, not all Stealth everywhere. |
| **Don't duplicate enchantments** | Cross-reference the enchantments list before finalizing any item. If "of Resistance (frost)" exists, a mundane item should not grant frost resistance. |
| **Load matters** | Q1–Q2 worn items should be 0 load while worn. Heavier gear items at 1–2 load create meaningful carry-capacity trade-offs. |
| **Consumable balance** | New alchemicals should not outperform existing ones at the same Quality. Blinding dust (Q2, 30 coins) blinds briefly and costs the same as an Acid Vial — comparable power for different purposes. |
| **Period authenticity** | Items must fit the Bronze Age setting. No magnetic compasses, glass optical instruments, or gunpowder-derived substances. When in doubt, find an ancient world analogue. |

## 7. Summary & Next Steps

### Coverage Summary

| Area | Items Proposed | Priority |
|------|---------------|----------|
| Equipment slot items | 41 | **High** — fills an empty design space for all non-Body slots |
| Classic adventuring gear | 26 | **High** — staple ruin/exploration items missing from the current list |
| Alchemical substances | 17 | **Medium** — expands options for alchemist characters and loot tables |
| Trap/tactical items | 6 | **Medium** — enables new combat and exploration tactics |

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Review & prioritize** — Select a first batch (15–20 items) for immediate implementation.
2. **Write full item entries** — Convert proposals into final format matching existing gear/alchemy tables.
3. **Playtest edge cases** — Test items like caltrops, iron-jaw snares, and blinding dust in combat to validate difficulty numbers and action costs.
4. **Update loot tables** — Integrate new items into treasure generation for appropriate tiers.
5. **Add slot items to equipment page** — Consider a new "Apparel" or "Wearables" equipment subcategory for non-armor slot items.

*This analysis identifies 90 new non-magical items spanning all 8 equipment slots, classic adventuring gear, alchemical substances, and tactical equipment. All proposals fit a Bronze Age sword-and-sorcery aesthetic, follow the principle of circumstantial advantage over statistical bonuses, and complement the existing magic item system rather than competing with it.*
