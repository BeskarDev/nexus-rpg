# Vaashk Lizardfolk — Phonetic Analysis

## Cultural Inspiration

Reptilian / primordial — no single historical analogue. Names evoke hissing, clicking, and guttural sounds of cold-blooded predators. Think swamp-dwellers with an alien, sibilant language.

## Tonal Identity

Hissing, cold, and alien. Names are dominated by sibilants, fricatives, and abrupt consonant clusters. The effect is distinctly inhuman — these are names shaped by forked tongues and scaled throats.

## Favoured Phonetic Arrangements

- Prefixes begin with sibilants or velar clusters (K'ra-, Ziss-, Slik-, T'ss-)
- Glottal stops and apostrophes appear within names (K'ra-, Sh'k-, T'ss-)
- Medial syllables are often single consonants or CC clusters (-ss, -th, -gn)
- Suffixes are abrupt: C or VC (-sh, -'th, -ik, -s)

## Typical Syllable Structure

- **Prefixes**: 1 syllable, CVC or C'CV (Grok-, Sh'k-, Vesh-)
- **Medial syllables**: C, CC, or CVC (-ss, -gul, -ran)
- **Suffixes**: C or VC (-sh, -ol, -ix, -t)
- Overall name length: 1–3 syllables (often short and harsh)

## Key Phonemes and Sounds

- **Consonants**: /s/, /ʃ/ (sh), /z/, /k/, /g/, /r/, /θ/ (th), /x/ (kh), /t/
- **Vowels**: /i/, /o/, /a/ — sparse and short
- **Characteristic clusters**: ss-, zz-, -'th, -gn, k'r-, t'ss-
- **Avoids**: open vowels, warm sounds, flowing patterns, nasals

## Design Notes

Names should feel fundamentally inhuman — hissed, clicked, and growled. The sibilant-heavy phonology makes these names instantly recognisable. Glottal stops and apostrophes add to the alien quality.
