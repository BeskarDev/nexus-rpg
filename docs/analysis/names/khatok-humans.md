# Khatok Humans — Phonetic Analysis

## Cultural Inspiration

Central Asian / Steppe — nomadic horsemen, tribal councils, and vast grasslands. Think Turkic and Mongolic influences — proud, practical, and wind-swept.

## Tonal Identity

Earthy, direct, and vigorous. Names have a grounded quality with strong consonants and open vowels. The rhythm is practical and unadorned — names of people who live under open skies.

## Favoured Phonetic Arrangements

- CVC prefixes with velar or uvular onsets (Kar-, Gho-, Hokh-)
- Short medial syllables, CV or CVC (-gu, -lok, -den)
- Suffixes are often single consonants or short VC (-m, -na, -k, -zi)
- Names are compact and functional

## Typical Syllable Structure

- **Prefixes**: 1–2 syllables, CVC or CV (Zho-, Taa-, Mar-)
- **Medial syllables**: CV or CVC (-bu, -xar, -an)
- **Suffixes**: C or VC (-m, -na, -sh, -ar)
- Overall name length: 2–3 syllables

## Key Phonemes and Sounds

- **Consonants**: /k/, /g/, /x/ (kh), /r/, /m/, /n/, /b/, /d/, /z/, /l/, /t/
- **Vowels**: /a/, /o/, /u/ dominate; open and grounded
- **Characteristic clusters**: kh-, gh-, -xar, -lok, -rok
- **Avoids**: palatals, sibilant clusters, overly refined sounds

## Design Notes

Names should feel like they belong to people of the open steppe — strong, direct, and carrying across wind-swept plains. Practical names for practical people.
