# Jakhaari Lionfolk — Phonetic Analysis

## Cultural Inspiration

West African / Sahelian — the great empires of the savanna. Think the grandeur of ancient Mali, Ghana, and Songhai — gold trade, oral tradition, and proud warrior-kings.

## Tonal Identity

Warm, rhythmic, and regal. Names flow with open vowels and voiced consonants, producing a musical quality. The cadence suggests oral storytelling traditions and sunlit savannas.

## Favoured Phonetic Arrangements

- CV or CVCV prefixes with voiced consonants (Sun-, Gao-, Man-, Fara-)
- Multi-syllable prefixes are common and give names their flowing character
- Medial syllables are typically CV (-di, -ma, -han)
- Suffixes end in open vowels or nasals (-tou, -ra, -na, -bi)

## Typical Syllable Structure

- **Prefixes**: 1–3 syllables, CV or CVCV (Za-, Kali-, Kassa-)
- **Medial syllables**: CV (-ma, -fo, -ke)
- **Suffixes**: CV or CVV (-tou, -ra, -ssa)
- Overall name length: 2–4 syllables

## Key Phonemes and Sounds

- **Consonants**: /m/, /n/, /k/, /d/, /b/, /f/, /r/, /s/, /l/, /g/
- **Vowels**: /a/, /o/, /u/ dominate; warm, open, and full
- **Characteristic clusters**: dj-, -ss-, -nd-, -mb-, -ou, -tou
- **Avoids**: harsh gutturals, heavy consonant clusters, cold sounds

## Design Notes

Names should feel like they echo across a sunlit savanna — warm, proud, and musical. Open vowels and flowing consonants create a sense of regal warmth. Each name should feel like it belongs to someone of proud lineage.
