# Saghal Lionfolk — Phonetic Analysis

## Cultural Inspiration

Fantasy jungle / primordial — predatory and mystical. A blend of exotic syllables suggesting creatures of deep jungle and shadow. Think prowling hunters in ancient forests, with hints of Fey wildness.

## Tonal Identity

Sleek, mysterious, and predatory. Names combine sharp consonants with liquid sounds, creating an exotic, slightly otherworldly feel. More feline and dangerous than the Jakhaari — hunters rather than kings.

## Favoured Phonetic Arrangements

- CVC or CV prefixes, often with unusual consonant combinations (Kith-, Nyx-, Thra-)
- Medial syllables include exotic clusters (-gla, -kan, -vin)
- Suffixes favour unusual endings (-yx, -va, -kso, -ir)
- Names have an unpredictable, exotic quality

## Typical Syllable Structure

- **Prefixes**: 1–2 syllables, CVC or CV (Zyl-, Fey-, Dusk-)
- **Medial syllables**: CVC or CV (-goth, -ler, -toth)
- **Suffixes**: VC or V (-yx, -ar, -lo, -a)
- Overall name length: 2–3 syllables

## Key Phonemes and Sounds

- **Consonants**: /k/, /θ/ (th), /r/, /l/, /n/, /s/, /ʃ/ (sh), /g/, /z/, /w/
- **Vowels**: /y/, /a/, /o/, /i/ — including unusual vowels
- **Characteristic clusters**: thr-, nyx-, -str-, -kso, glim-, wyl-
- **Avoids**: warm open vowels (reserved for Jakhaari), simple CV patterns

## Design Notes

Names should feel like shadows moving through undergrowth — sleek, sharp, and slightly alien. The exotic consonant clusters and unusual vowels set Saghal apart from all other cultures. Each name should feel like it belongs to a creature more comfortable in darkness than sunlight.
