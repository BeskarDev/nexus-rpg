# Mahruk Dwarves — Phonetic Analysis

## Cultural Inspiration

Phoenician / Canaanite — seafaring traders and coastal city-builders. Purple dye, glass-blowing, and far-reaching merchant networks.

## Tonal Identity

Clipped, mercantile, and brisk. Names carry the rhythm of commerce and sea travel — shorter, more agile than Ghahar names, with a Levantine coastal flavour.

## Favoured Phonetic Arrangements

- CVC prefixes with emphatic consonants (Tyr-, Qar-, Esh-)
- Suffixes ending in voiced stops or sibilants (-os, -im, -bul)
- Consonant clusters favour liquids and nasals (-mr-, -nl-)
- Less ponderous than Ghahar — more clipped and efficient

## Typical Syllable Structure

- **Prefixes**: 1–2 syllables, CVC common (Sid-, Byb-, Gad-)
- **Medial syllables**: CV or CVC (-on, -mun, -af)
- **Suffixes**: VC or CVC (-os, -el, -ra)
- Overall name length: 2–3 syllables

## Key Phonemes and Sounds

- **Consonants**: /t/, /s/, /ʃ/ (sh), /q/, /b/, /r/, /l/, /m/, /n/, /z/
- **Vowels**: /a/, /o/, /i/ dominate; /u/ is secondary
- **Characteristic clusters**: -sh-, -zz-, -th, -bul, -ram
- **Avoids**: overly guttural sounds, heavy clusters

## Design Notes

Names should feel efficient and worldly — like merchants who speak many tongues. Slightly lighter than Ghahar but still Semitic in character. Think coastal trade-towns, not deep mountain halls.
