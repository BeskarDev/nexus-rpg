# Snikrez Goblins — Phonetic Analysis

## Cultural Inspiration

No single historical analogue — goblins are a chaotic blend of guttural, sibilant sounds suggesting creatures of the undergrowth, caves, and swamps. Think feral, quick, and scrappy.

## Tonal Identity

Harsh, staccato, and unrefined. Names are jagged and quick, full of consonant clusters, abrupt stops, and nasal buzz. They sound like they were spat out rather than spoken — raw, primal, and faintly comic.

## Favoured Phonetic Arrangements

- CVC or CVCC prefixes with harsh onsets (Grub-, Klarg-, Blech-)
- Medial syllables are often a single consonant or CC (-z, -sh, -rik)
- Suffixes are abrupt: single consonants or short VC (-n, -uk, -ag, -t)
- Maximum consonant density, minimum vowel content

## Typical Syllable Structure

- **Prefixes**: 1 syllable, CVC or CCVC (Zog-, Snar-, Frott-)
- **Medial syllables**: C, CC, or CVC (-z, -guz, -rit)
- **Suffixes**: C or VC (-n, -uk, -ik, -t)
- Overall name length: 1–3 syllables (often short)

## Key Phonemes and Sounds

- **Consonants**: /g/, /k/, /z/, /ʃ/ (sh), /r/, /t/, /b/, /s/, /n/, /l/
- **Vowels**: /u/, /i/, /o/ dominate; short and grunted
- **Characteristic clusters**: gr-, kl-, bl-, -gn-, -zz-, -sh-
- **Avoids**: long vowels, flowing sounds, elegant patterns

## Design Notes

Names should feel like they were invented by creatures who don't much care for pronunciation. Harsh, quick, and full of character. Each name should be fun to say aloud — ugly in an endearing way.
