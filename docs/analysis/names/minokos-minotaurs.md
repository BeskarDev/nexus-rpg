# Minokos Minotaurs — Phonetic Analysis

## Cultural Inspiration

Minoan / Cretan — the labyrinthine palace culture of ancient Crete. Bull-leaping, frescoes, maritime trade, and the myth of the labyrinth. Names carry the weight of bronze-age Aegean civilisation.

## Tonal Identity

Noble, archaic, and resonant. Names blend Greek phonetic structure with a more ancient, pre-Hellenic quality. Strong vowel endings and liquid consonants give names a stately, almost ceremonial feel.

## Favoured Phonetic Arrangements

- CV or CVC prefixes, often with aspirated consonants (Aeth-, Phai-, Therr-)
- Medial syllables tend to be CVC or CV (-khos, -men, -ion)
- Suffixes strongly favour Greek-inspired endings (-on, -os, -us, -ax, -as)
- Names have a formal, dignified cadence

## Typical Syllable Structure

- **Prefixes**: 1–2 syllables, CV or CVC (Ta-, Kno-, Eu-, Aeg-)
- **Medial syllables**: CVC or CV (-sor, -ri, -alos)
- **Suffixes**: VC or V (-on, -os, -us, -a)
- Overall name length: 2–4 syllables

## Key Phonemes and Sounds

- **Consonants**: /t/, /k/, /r/, /s/, /θ/ (th), /n/, /m/, /l/, /p/, /d/
- **Vowels**: /o/, /a/, /e/, /i/ — open and sonorous
- **Characteristic clusters**: -th-, -ph-, -rr-, -kh-, -os, -on, -eus
- **Avoids**: guttural sounds, harsh consonant clusters, short abrupt endings

## Design Notes

Names should feel like they were inscribed on palace walls — noble, resonant, and ancient. The Minoan inspiration gives minotaurs a civilised, almost regal quality that contrasts wonderfully with their bestial nature. Each name should carry the gravitas of an ancient king.
