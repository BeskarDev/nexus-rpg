# Ghahar Dwarves — Phonetic Analysis

## Cultural Inspiration

Babylonian / Sumerian — the deep, ancient cradle of civilization. Stone-carved temples, cuneiform tablets, and ziggurat-builders.

## Tonal Identity

Heavy, resonant, and grounded. Names carry the weight of stone and the authority of ancient edicts. Voiced stops and guttural fricatives dominate, producing a deliberate, measured cadence.

## Favoured Phonetic Arrangements

- CV (consonant–vowel) and CVC syllables are most common
- Prefixes often end in a hard consonant before a hyphen (Shar-, Bel-, Kish-)
- Suffixes tend to end in voiced consonants or nasals (-tum, -im, -rum)
- Compound clusters are rare; flow is syllabic and deliberate

## Typical Syllable Structure

- **Prefixes**: 1–2 syllables, often CVC or CV (Ad-, Ina-, Shar-)
- **Medial syllables**: CV or CVC (-ru, -gal, -nap)
- **Suffixes**: CVC or VC (-ti, -ilu, -dur)
- Overall name length: 2–4 syllables

## Key Phonemes and Sounds

- **Consonants**: /ʃ/ (sh), /k/, /g/, /n/, /r/, /m/, /b/, /d/, /t/, /l/
- **Vowels**: /a/, /u/, /i/ dominate; /e/ and /o/ are secondary
- **Characteristic clusters**: -sh-, -kh-, -gal, -rum, -tum
- **Avoids**: light or breathy sounds, diphthongs, palatals

## Design Notes

Names should feel carved from stone — weighty, deliberate, and old. Avoid light or airy sounds. Favour hard stops paired with resonant nasals and liquids.
