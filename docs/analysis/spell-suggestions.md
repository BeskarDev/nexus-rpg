## Implementation Notes

### Design Principles Applied

1. **Thematic Coherence**: All suggestions align with aspects from magic system instructions
2. **Role Balance**: Prioritized Excel and Decent roles for each tradition/discipline
3. **Damage Type Alignment**: Used appropriate damage types per tradition/discipline
4. **Mystic vs Arcane Identity**: Maintained transgressive vs reverent distinction
5. **Classic Coverage**: Addressed 30 missing classic fantasy spells
6. **Rank Distribution**: Focused on filling rank 3-5 gaps (126 of 177 suggestions)

### Where Both Arcane and Mystic Variants Could Exist

Some classic spells have both arcane and mystic interpretations but are placed in single tradition/discipline based on best thematic fit:

- **Teleport**: Peace (mystic) vs Conjuration (arcane) - Both valid, placed in each
- **Invisibility**: Twilight (mystic) vs Illusion (arcane) - Illusion has it, Twilight gets Shadow Walk
- **Haste/Slow**: War (mystic) vs Transmutation - Arcane version could be Telekinetics
- **Resurrection**: Life (mystic) vs Necromancy (arcane) - Life only, Necromancy opposes
- **Fear**: Death (mystic) vs Illusion/Telepathy (arcane) - Both traditions have versions
- **Shield**: Peace (mystic) vs Evocation/Conjuration (arcane) - Both can have versions

### Expansion Priorities by Tradition/Discipline

**Most Urgent** (undersized + missing core aspects):
1. War (10 → 20): Needs rank 3+ variety across all aspects
2. Peace (13 → 25): Missing travel and law aspects entirely
3. Telepathy (15 → 32): Missing memory manipulation and communication spells

**High Priority** (incomplete spells + rank 5 gaps):
4. Telekinetics (14 → 26): 3 incomplete spells + rank 5 capstones
5. Conjuration (24 → 38): 3 incomplete R4 spells + utility classics
6. Tempest (33 → 42): 3 incomplete R4 spells + rank 5 capstones

**Medium Priority** (rank 5 + classic gaps):
7. Illusion (19 → 29): 1 incomplete + rank 4-5 missing
8. Light (16 → 24): Rank 4-5 missing + truth aspect expansion
9. Life (14 → 24): Rank 3+ limited, missing resurrection-tier
10. Twilight (20 → 30): 1 incomplete + rank 5 missing

**Lower Priority** (well-developed, just need rank 5):
11. Evocation (16 → 26): Just needs rank 3+ variety
12. Death (16 → 26): Just needs disease mechanics + rank 5
13. Nature (30 → 40): 2 incomplete R4 + rank 5
14. Necromancy (30 → 37): Just 1 incomplete + rank 5

3. **Create Spells**: Use spell creation instructions to develop full spell entries
4. **Playtest**: Validate power levels against rank expectations
5. **Iterate**: Adjust based on feedback and system integration
