# Spell Rank Power Level Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the appropriate power level for each spell rank in Nexus RPG, with particular focus on ensuring rank 5 spells are appropriately scaled rather than "world-shattering" like D&D level 9 spells.

## D&D Power Level Equivalence

### Target Scaling
- **Nexus Rank 0-1** ≈ D&D Levels 0-2 (Cantrips and low-level utility)
- **Nexus Rank 2-3** ≈ D&D Levels 3-5 (Fireball, Lightning Bolt territory)
- **Nexus Rank 4** ≈ D&D Level 6 (Powerful but bounded effects)
- **Nexus Rank 5** ≈ D&D Level 7 (Impressive but mortal-scale)

### D&D Level 7 Examples (Target for Rank 5)
- **Delayed Blast Fireball** - More powerful version of Fireball, not reality-warping
- **Plane Shift** - Planar travel, but requires knowing destination
- **Reverse Gravity** - Impressive environmental control, limited area
- **Finger of Death** - Powerful single-target damage, not instant kill
- **Etherealness** - Unique tactical advantage, temporary
- **Forcecage** - Powerful battlefield control, but escapable
- **Regenerate** - Restore lost limbs, not resurrection

**NOT D&D Level 9 Examples** (Too powerful):
- ❌ Wish - Reality alteration
- ❌ True Resurrection - Bring back long-dead
- ❌ Meteor Swarm - City-destroying power
- ❌ Time Stop - Break action economy
- ❌ Imprisonment - Permanent banishment
- ❌ True Polymorph - Permanent transformation

## Current Rank Progression Analysis

### Rank 3 Spells (Focus 6, TN 12)
**Damage Scaling**: +6/+12/+18
**Examples**:
- Black Flame Bolt (Evocation): +6/+12/+18 fire + ignores resistance
- Arcane Blast (Conjuration): +6/+12/+18 blast + push
- Solar Flare (Light): +6/+12/+18 radiant AoE + heal allies +3/+6/+9
- Vitality Surge (Life): +6/+12/+18 radiant cone + heal allies +3/+6/+9

**Characteristics**:
- Strong single-target or AoE damage
- Battlefield-shaping effects
- Hybrid damage + utility
- Short duration powerful buffs (Blessing of Dawn)

### Rank 4 Spells (Focus 8, TN 14)
**Examples**:
- Arcane Empowerment: Add Arcana to spell damage, -2 Focus cost, resistance to 8 damage types
- Embrace of Night: Invisibility in darkness + phase through walls + -2 Focus cost
- Avatar of Storms: Flight + 10 temp HP + resistances + add Mysticism to damage
- Control Water: Massive environmental manipulation over long distances

**Characteristics**:
- Transformation/empowerment effects
- Cost reduction + damage boost
- Large-scale environmental control
- Sustained tactical advantages
- Still bounded by "short duration" for most effects
- Still require concentration
- Have drawbacks (fatigue, etc.)

### Appropriate Rank 5 Power Level

**Focus Cost**: 10 (following progression)
**Target Number**: Legendary (16)
**Duration**: Short to Medium (not permanent)
**Scope**: Impressive but mortal-scale

**Power Guidelines**:
1. **Damage**: +8 to +10 base (not higher than +12/+24/+36)
2. **Area**: Large zones but not "entire battlefield"
3. **Duration**: Medium duration maximum (not permanent)
4. **Effects**: Powerful but escapable/counterable
5. **Transformations**: Enhanced versions of rank 4, not immortality
6. **Control**: Significant battlefield impact, not total domination
7. **No Instant Wins**: No "I win" buttons or permanent solutions

## Power Scaling Summary

### Damage Progression
| Rank | Single Target | AoE (multi-target) | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| 0 | +2/+4/+6 | +2/+4/+6 (small) | Cantrip level |
| 1 | +4/+8/+12 | +2/+4/+6 (cone/line) | Basic combat |
| 2 | +6/+12/+18 | +6/+12/+18 (area) | Fireball equivalent |
| 3 | +8/+16/+24 | +8/+16/+24 (area) | Powerful |
| 4 | N/A | N/A | Focus on buffs/control |
| 5 | +10/+20/+30 | +10/+20/+30 (area) | Peak power, not world-ending |

### Spell Characteristics by Rank
| Rank | Focus | TN | Duration | Scope | Power Level |
|------|-------|-----|----------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | 0 | Easy (6) | Briefly-Short | Personal/Single | Minor utility |
| 1 | 2 | Medium (8) | Short-Medium | Close area | Useful combat |
| 2 | 4 | Hard (10) | Short-Medium | Short area | Battlefield impact |
| 3 | 6 | Very Hard (12) | Short-Medium | Medium area | Major impact |
| 4 | 8 | Extreme (14) | Short-Medium | Large area/self | Transformation |
| 5 | 10 | Legendary (16) | Short-Medium | Large area | Peak mortal power |

### Key Principles for Rank 5
1. **Impressive but Bounded**: Effects should be powerful but not permanent or unbeatable
2. **Escapable**: Enemies should have saving throws, spell resistance, or countermeasures
3. **Temporary**: Maximum medium duration, most effects short duration
4. **Costly**: High Focus cost (10), often with Fatigue or other drawbacks
5. **Difficult**: Legendary TN (16) makes them challenging to cast
6. **Mortal Scale**: Affects battlefield/encounter, not entire armies or cities
7. **No Instant Wins**: No auto-kills, permanent transformations, or reality warping
8. **Concentration**: Most powerful effects require concentration (can be broken)

## Comparison to Current Rank 4

Rank 5 should be **~150% as powerful** as Rank 4, not 300%:
- Rank 4: Focus 8, TN 14, short duration transformations with drawbacks
- Rank 5: Focus 10, TN 16, slightly better transformations or more powerful direct effects

**Example Comparison**:
- **Rank 4** Avatar of Storms: +2 lightning to attackers, add Mysticism to damage
- **Rank 5** Storm Lord: +4 lightning to attackers, add Mysticism to damage, immunity to weather, flight enhancement

This is significant but not game-breaking.

## Conclusion

Rank 5 spells should represent the **pinnacle of mortal magical achievement**, not godlike power. They are impressive, difficult to cast, and powerful enough to turn the tide of major battles - but they don't reshape reality, grant immortality, or provide permanent solutions.

The revised recommendations above aim for the D&D Level 7 equivalent: powerful, memorable, tactically significant, but still within the bounds of mortal magic in a Bronze Age sword & sorcery setting.
