# üé≤ Random Treasure

## Random Treasure

Either when preparing for a gaming session as the GM or when wanting to randomly determine some treasure during the game, you can use the tables below to get some inspiration. Note that you won‚Äôt get only concrete results from these tables, but more so the general category and type of the treasure.

The general value and Quality of treasure is determined by the required adventuring tier to acquire it. There are three categories of treasure. ‚ÄúSimple Loot‚Äù includes the belongings of a single creature of equal strength to the adventuring tier or a smaller reward that might be the result from a discovery during exploration. A ‚ÄúMinor Treasure‚Äù is something kept hidden behind a puzzle or lethal trap, or a smaller hoard protected by a group of creature or one especially powerful one. Lastly a ‚ÄúMajor Treasure‚Äù is something found in a large treasure hoard or a reward for an entire adventure.

| Adventuring Tier | Simple Loot | Minor Treasure | Major Treasure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (fresh) | Quality 1 (~50 coins) | Quality 2 (~200 coins) | Quality 3 (~500 coins) |
| 2 (capable) | Quality 2 (~200 coins) | Quality 3 (~500 coins) | Quality 4 (~2,000 coins) |
| 3 (experienced) | Quality 3 (~500 coins) | Quality 4 (~2,000 coins) | Quality 5 (~10,000 coins) |
| 4 (seasoned) | Quality 4 (~2,000 coins) | Quality 5 (~10,000 coins) | Quality 6 (~50,000 coins) |
| 5 (heroic) | Quality 5 (~10,000 coins) | Quality 6 (~50,000 coins) | Quality 7 (~250,000 coins) |
| 6 (legendary) | Quality 6 (~50,000 coins) | Quality 7 (~250,000 coins) | Quality 8 (~1,000,000 coins) |

To use these tables, roll 1d6 and 1d12 together. The d6 result determines the Treasure Type and the d12 result the specific item of that type. If something doesn‚Äôt fit the situation, you may re-roll one or both of the dice until you do (GMs discretion).

With these tables you will only roll mundane types of items. It is also up to the GM if a randomly determined treasure should be enchanted or some wonderous item. As a guideline, any treasure of Quality 4 or higher can have magical properties.
