# Creature Cards

This tool converts creature stat blocks from markdown format into printable cards for easy reference during tabletop sessions.

## How to Use

1. **Upload or paste** your creature markdown content
2. **Parse** the markdown to extract creature data
3. **Select** which creatures to print
4. **Print** the cards on standard paper

The system intelligently creates:
- **Compact cards** for simple creatures (single card with all info)
- **Detail cards** for complex creatures (separate cards for stats, attacks, and abilities)

## Markdown Format

Your creature stat blocks should follow this format:

```markdown
## Creature Name
