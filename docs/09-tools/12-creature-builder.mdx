# üêâ Creature Builder

The Creature Builder Tool helps you create balanced, modular creatures and enemies for Nexus RPG. This tool streamlines the creature creation process by:

- Combining base stats per Tier (0-10)
- Allowing selection of archetype (Ambusher, Artillery, Bruiser, etc.) which modifies stats
- Supporting creature categories (Basic, Elite, Lord) with automatic life pool formatting
- Providing tier validation to ensure balanced creatures
- Generating markdown output compatible with the Creature Cards tool

## Quick Start

<BrowserOnly fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  {() => <CreatureBuilderWrapper />}
</BrowserOnly>

## How to Use

### 1. Select Basic Parameters

- **Creature Name**: Give your creature a descriptive name
- **Tier**: Choose from 0 (Harmless) to 10 (Godlike) - determines base power level
- **Category**: 
  - **Basic** - Standard creatures with 1 wound (e.g., "40 HP")
  - **Elite** - Stronger creatures with 2 life pools (e.g., "2√ó40 HP")
  - **Lord** - Boss creatures with 3 life pools (e.g., "3√ó40 HP")
- **Size**: From Tiny to Colossal - affects defenses and armor
- **Type**: Animal, Beast, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Humanoid, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, or Undead

### 2. Choose an Archetype

Each archetype modifies the creature's stats to fit a specific combat role:

- **Standard** - Baseline generalist with no special modifiers
- **Ambusher** - High dodge, fast movement, strikes from surprise
- **Artillery** - Long-range damage dealer, fragile defenses
- **Bruiser** - High HP and parry, frontline damage dealer
- **Defender** - Maximum HP, heavy armor, protects allies
- **Horde** - Low stats, meant for large groups
- **Controller** - High resist, battlefield manipulation
- **Ranged** - Balanced ranged attacker
- **Skirmisher** - High dodge and movement, hit-and-run tactics
- **Support** - High resist, buffs and heals allies

### 3. Review Generated Stats

The tool automatically calculates:

- **HP** - With proper Elite/Lord formatting (e.g., "2√ó40")
- **AV** - Armor value based on tier, archetype, and size
- **Attributes** - STR, AGI, SPI, MND set to tier-appropriate dice
- **Defenses** - Parry, Dodge, and Resist adjusted for archetype and size

### 4. Tier Validation

The tool validates your creature's stats and displays warnings if:
- HP is outside the expected range for the tier (¬±2 tiers)
- AV is too high or too low for the tier
- Average defense values don't match the expected tier range

Warnings help ensure your creature is appropriately balanced for its intended challenge level.

### 5. Export

Switch to the **Markdown** tab to copy the creature's stat block. This output is compatible with the Creature Cards tool for printing physical creature cards.

## Design Guidelines

### Tier System

| Tier | Name | HP | Defense | Max Attribute | Purpose |
|------|------|----|---------|--------------|--------------------|
| 0 | Harmless | 5 | 6 | d6 | Trivial encounters |
| 1 | Capable | 10 | 7 | d6 | Level 1 challenge |
| 2 | Dangerous | 20 | 8 | d8 | Level 2 challenge |
| 3 | Ferocious | 30 | 9 | d8 | Level 3 challenge |
| 4 | Monstrous | 40 | 10 | d10 | Level 4 challenge |
| 5 | Primeval | 50 | 11 | d10 | Level 5 challenge |
| 6 | Ancient | 60 | 12 | d12 | Level 6 challenge |
| 7 | Legendary | 70 | 13 | d12 | Level 7 challenge |
| 8 | Mythic | 80 | 14 | d12+1 | Level 8 challenge |
| 9 | Divine | 90 | 15 | d12+1 | Level 9 challenge |
| 10 | Godlike | 100 | 16 | d12+2 | Level 10 challenge |

A single creature of any Tier should provide a decent challenge for one adventurer of the same level.
