# 🎲 Random Treasure

## Random Treasure

Either when preparing for a gaming session as the GM or when wanting to randomly determine some treasure during the game, you can use the tables below to get some inspiration. Note that you won’t get only concrete results from these tables, but more so the general category and type of the treasure.

The general value and Quality of treasure is determined by the required adventuring tier to acquire it. There are three categories of treasure. “Simple Loot” includes the belongings of a single creature of equal strength to the adventuring tier or a smaller reward that might be the result from a discovery during exploration. A “Minor Treasure” is something kept hidden behind a puzzle or lethal trap, or a smaller hoard protected by a group of creature or one especially powerful one. Lastly a “Major Treasure” is something found in a large treasure hoard or a reward for an entire adventure.

### Simple Loot

Something found on individual creatures or in larger amounts in a treasure hoard.

### Minor Treasure

Something found in a treasure chest or other smaller cache of loot. Often requires to complete a puzzle, disarm a trap, or find a secret.

### Major Treasure

Powerful items marking the peak of any treasure hoard, often requiring the conquest of a whole dungeon, defeating a powerful leader, or the completion of a perilous quest.

## Random Treasure by Level

| Level | Simple Loot | Minor Treasure | Major Treasure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 x Q1 | 1 x Q2, 1d3 x Q1 | 1 x Q3, 1d3 x Q2, 1d3 x Q1 |
| 2 | 1d3 x Q1 | 1d3 x Q2, 1d3 Q1 | 1d3 x Q3, 1d3 x Q2, 1d3 x Q1 |
| 3 | 1 x Q2 | 1 x Q3, 1 x Q2 | 1 x Q4, 1d3 x Q3, 1d3 x Q2 |
| 4 | 1d3 x Q2 | 1d3 x Q3, 1d3 x Q2 | 1d3 x Q4, 1d3 x Q3, 1d3 x Q2 |
| 5 | 1 x Q3 | 1 x Q4, 1 x Q3 | 1 x Q5, 1d3 x Q4, 1d3 x Q3 |
| 6 | 1d3 x Q3 | 1d3 x Q4, 1d3 x Q3 | 1d3 x Q5, 1d3 x Q4, 1d3 x Q3 |
| 7 | 1 x Q4 | 1 x Q5, 1 x Q4 | 1 x Q6, 1d3 x Q5, 1d3 x Q4 |
| 8 | 1d3 x Q4 | 1d3 x Q5, 1d3 x Q4 | 1d3 x Q6, 1d3 x Q5, 1d3 x Q4 |
| 9 | 1 x Q5 | 1 x Q6, 1 x Q5 | 1 x Q7, 1d3 x Q6, 1d3 x Q5 |
| 10 | 1d3 x Q5 | 1d3 x Q6, 1d3 x Q5 | 1d3 x Q7, 1d3 x Q6, 1d3 x Q5 |

> Each entry for a reward can be replaced with a higher amount of rewards of one Quality lower (1 → 1d3 → 2d3 → 3d3 → etc.). So you can replace 1 x Q4 with 1d3 x Q3 or 2d3 x Q2 for example.
Roll for each reward‘s treasure type. You can insteas roll 1d6+6 for one item of the highest available Quality, if you want it to be something other than a valuable.
> 

To use these tables, roll 2d12 together. The first result determines the Treasure Type and the second result the specific item of that type. If something doesn’t fit the situation, you may re-roll one or both of the dice until you do (GMs discretion). You can then roll on the respective tables for the result you rolled to know specifically what type of item it is.

With these tables you will only roll mundane types of items. It is also up to the GM if a randomly determined treasure should be enchanted or some wonderous item. As a guideline, any treasure of Quality 4 or higher can have magical properties.
