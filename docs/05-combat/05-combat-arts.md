# ðŸ”¶ Combat Arts

## Learning Combat Arts

An adventurer can learn many different Combat Arts throughout their career. When you first learn either the Fighting or Archery skill, you can choose one Combat Arts for melee or ranged weapons respectively. Once you gain a rank in either skill, you can choose another appropriate Combat Art. You can learn additional Combat Arts through talents.

## Using Combat Arts

You can use an appropriate Combat Art as part of an attack on your turn. The attack deals itâ€™s normal damage in addition to the Combat Artâ€™s effects. You can only use one Combat Art per turn and each individual Combat Art can only be used once per combat.
