# üìè Distances & Movement

## Distances

Various effects and abilities list of of the following distances to describe their range.

| Distance | Description | In Meters | In Areas |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Melee | touching or fighting distance | <2 meters | 0 areas |
| Close | within a few steps | 2-4 meters | 0 areas |
| Short | normal speaking distance | 5-10 meters | 1 area |
| Medium | a short sprint | 11-20 meters | 2 areas |
| Long | louder shouting distance | 21-40 meters | 3-4 areas |
| Very Long | unhindered viewing distance | 41-80 meters | 5-8 areas |
| Extreme | barely perceivable if at all | 81+ meters | 9+ areas |

## Movement

Movement describes your ability to move between or within areas in combat. Normally, 1 Movement lets you move to one area within short distance.

Some areas have the property ‚Äúdifficult terrain‚Äù and require 2 Movement to be entered and 1 Movement to move close. This Movement can happen over multiple combat turns, as long as no Movement is spent for any other purpose in between.

### Moving into melee range

When you are close to another creature, you can choose to move into melee range of them. Similarly, you can choose to move out of melee range. You can do one of both once on your turns without spending any Movement. Doing it multiple times on the same turn costs 1 Movement each time beyond the first.

Being in melee range can be shared between groups of multiple creatures, as makes sense. So, when you move into melee range of a creature that is already in melee range of a second creature, all three of you are now in melee range of each other. Moving out of melee range triggers an Opportunity Attack from all enemies you were in melee range of.

You can also move in melee range of specific locations or objects within an area, such as cover.

### Falling Damage

When you fall uncontrollably for a close or longer distance, you take falling damage upon hitting the ground. Falling damage ignores AV and increases with each distance.

You generally fall an extreme distance during one encounter turn, or until you hit the ground.

When you attempt to control your fall, roll Agility + Athletics. You can only attempt this roll if you initiated the fall by yourself. The difficulty is easy for a close distance and is increased by one step for each additional falling distance. If you succeed, you reduce the damage you take to one step lower.

| Distance | Close | Short | Medium | Long | Very Long | Extreme |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Damage | 5 | 10 | 20 | 40 | 60 | 100 |

### Moving Objects

You are able to move heavy objects depending on your Strength:

- up to 3 x Strength: move normally.
- up to 10 x Strength: move as in difficult terrain.
- up to 20 x Strength: move a short distance over one delving turn.

> These ranged assume you have move the object without support. For example, dragging an object on the ground instead of carrying it might increase the size and weight of objects you can move.

### Crawling, Crouching, Climbing, and Swimming

With these variants of Movement, you move as if in difficult terrain (2 Movement instead of 1 for a short distance). You might also be required to succeed on a Strength/Agility + Athletics roll to be able to move at all, as when climbing along a crumbling wall, or swimming in rushing waters.

### Jumping

If you moved at least a close distance, you can jump a close distance without rolling. Otherwise, you have to succeed on a Strength + Athletics roll.

### Suffering conditions during Movement

If you are swimming or flying and suffer conditions that reduce your Movement to 0 or drop you prone, you lose control of your Movement. You immediately start drowning or falling respectively. You drown for a short distance or fall a very long distance each turn you can‚Äòt move.

If you are climbing and are pushed or knocked prone, you also lose control of your Movement and start falling. Though you might be able to stop your fall by succeeding on a Strength/Agility + Athletics roll. If you do, you stop falling after the distance you were pushed, or a close distance otherwise.

## Areas

Areas are an abstraction of connected spaces during combat. When using a battle map for combat, define enclosed areas for small, connected spaces. Combatants within the same area are close to each other, while those one area apart are within short distance of each other, and so on.

> For visualisation, you can use index cards for individual areas. Write down a distinct name for each card and note its area properties. Place your cards next to each other to show how they are connected. You can use any gaming tokens for active combatants and place them onto the cards. Group up tokens that are in a melee.

### Area Properties

Areas are seldom flat, featureless places. Most often they are part of a building or natural environment which proves different properties for all combatants that attempt to move into them or are within them.

Examples of area properties include:

- **Dim Light.** Any rolls requiring sight in or through this area suffer +1 bane.
- **Total Darkness.** Any creature is considered blinded for looking into or through this area.
- **Difficult Terrain.** Requires 2 Movement to move into this area (you can spend this Movement over multiple turns). Moving into or out of melee range requires 1 Movement.
- **Elevated.** This area is up-hill or on a higher elevation. Ranged attacks from this area to an un-elevated area gain +1 boon. Special movement such as climbing or flying might be required to enter this area.
- **Tiny.** All creatures in this area are automatically in melee range of each other.
- **Special Location.** This area includes a special location that creatures can move into melee range with, to gain certain effects. Examples are a lever for a nearby drawbridge, a magical fountain with healing water, or a pillar which can be climbed or hidden behind.
