## Learning Combat Arts

An adventurer can learn many different Combat Arts throughout their career. When you first learn either the Fighting or Archery skill, you can choose one Combat Art for melee or ranged weapons respectively. Once you gain a rank in either skill, you can choose another appropriate Combat Art. You can learn additional Combat Arts through talents.

### Learning Supreme Combat Arts

Supreme Combat Arts represent the ultimate abilities any warrior can achieve, demonstrating their mastery over their combat abilities. They transcend mere physical ability and tap into the very power of a warrior‘s soul, which is only possible for true masters of combat.

Obtaining the ability to use Supreme Combat Arts is possible via the talents Art of Fighting for melee weapons and Art of Archery for ranged weapons at rank 4 or higher respectively. Some Supreme Combat Arts require you to already have learned their basic form and replace those abilities. Any other abilities referencing the basic version of a Combat Art are also usable with their supreme form.


## Using Combat Arts

You can use an appropriate Combat Art as part of an attack on your turn. You must declare you are using a Combat Art before rolling for the attack. On a hit, the attack deals its normal damage in addition to the Combat Art’s effects. You can only use one Combat Art per turn and each individual Combat Art can only be used once per combat.
