# ðŸ¤º Attacking

You can attack with various weapons in melee or at range. You can also attack with a spell.

| Attack | Skill Roll | Defense |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Melee Weapon | Strength + Fighting | Parry |
| Ranged Weapon | Agility + Archery | Dodge |
| Mystic Spell | Spirit + Mysticism | depends on the spell |
| Arcane Spell | Mind + Arcana | depends on the spell |

### Weapon Attacks

You have to have learned the skill required by your weapon (Fighting for melee weapons, Archery for ranged) or you suffer +1 bane on the attack. When you roll a weapon attack, you add effects based on the SL.

| SL | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Blunder | Choose one:<br/>- Roll a Durability Check for the weapon you attacked with.<br/>- Roll a Supply Check if your weapon uses ammo.<br/>- One item you are holding is knocked to the ground somewhere close. |
| Failure | You miss your target. |
| Weak | You hit your target with 1 x weapon damage. |
| Strong | You hit your target with 2 x weapon damage. |
| Critical | You hit your target with 3 x weapon damage.<br/>Also, the target has to roll a Durability Check for their armor, helmet, shield, weapon, or other held item (their choice). |

## Melee Attacks

To attack with a melee weapon or spell you have to be in melee range of your target. Reach weapons can be used at close range instead.

### Unarmed Attacks

When you have nothing to defend yourself with, you can still throw a punch. Fighting unarmed doesnâ€™t count as wielding a weapon, and reduces your base Parry to 6. When you hit with an unarmed attack, you only deal your base damage but no weapon damage (you can still benefit from other effects that increase your damage).

### Non-lethal Attacks

When you hit an enemy with a melee weapon and you would inflict an Injury on them, you can choose to inflict two Fatigue on them instead. When doing so, the target also has to roll Strength + Fortitude. The difficulty of the roll is moderate (8) for a target with one Wound or hard (10) for a target with two Wounds. The target automatically fails, if they suffer their third Wound from your attack. If they fail, they fall unconscious for a short duration, or until they are woken up by another creature or effect.

## Ranged Attacks

Ranged attacks require your target to be visible and within your weaponâ€™s or spellâ€™s range.

### Attacking at a higher range

When attacking with a ranged weapon or spell at any range further than medium or a thrown weapon at any further range than short, you suffer a cumulative +1 bane for each range category beyond that range. You canâ€™t attack beyond the range listed for the weapon or spell.

### Cover

If the target is only partially visible, add +1 bane to your ranged attack against them.

### Shooting into or out of Melee

When you attack a target at range that is in melee with other creatures, you suffer +1 bane on the roll. If you roll a blunder for this attack, you accidentally hit one of those creatures. Randomly determine which creature is hit. They take damage equal to your weapon or weak spell damage.

When you attack at range while you have enemies you are in melee with, you suffer +1 bane on the roll as well.

### Missing with a thrown Alchemical

When you miss your target when throwing an alchemical item that has some area effect, determine a random adjacent area of the original target. The alchemical erupts at the new location.

## Damage

On a successful attack, you deal damage to the enemy.

- Your base damage is equal to half of the attribute you rolled your attack with. Per default, this is 1/2 Strength for melee weapons, 1/2 Agility for ranged weapons, 1/2 Spirit for mystic spells, and 1/2 Mind for arcane spells.
- You add extra damage from your weapon or spell, plus any extra damage from abilities or other effects.
- The total amount of damage is then reduced by the enemyâ€™s Armor Value (AV). Your damage canâ€™t be reduced below 1.

If you use a weapon or cast a spell that adds a specific damage type, such as fire, all of the damage from the attack counts as that damage type.

### Lasting Damage

When some effect inflicts some amount of lasting damage on you, you first take no damage from it. Instead, at the start of each of your turns, you take that amount of damage (ignoring Armor). You continue to take the lasting damage, until the effect ends, or you remove it via some action. For example, the bleed property inflicts lasting damage, which can be removed by rolling Spirit + Nature as an Action.

### Damage Types

There exist multiple damage types which describe the various ways of inflicting harm. If some effect adds damage of a specific type to an attack, all of the attackâ€˜s damage is treated as that damage type.

> If an attack, spell, or effect mentions no specific damage type, the damage is always assumed to be physical.
>

| Damage Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Acid | corroding or melting |
| Blast | booming or shattering |
| Fire | burning or exploding |
| Frost | freezing or petrifying |
| Lightning | shocking or searing |
| Necrotic | draining or withering |
| Psychic | mental or spiritual harm |
| Physical | weapons or objects |
| Poison | poisoning or weakening |
| Radiant | beaming or radiating |

### Resistances or Weaknesses to Damage Types

Adventurers and other creatures can gain resistances or weaknesses to certain damage types.

- Resistance: You take 1/2 x damage (rounded up).
- Weakness: You take 1.5 x damage (rounded up).

You apply these modifiers after subtracting your AV or modifying the damage in any other way. If you gain resistance or weakness from multiple conditions against the same damage, you still only apply it once. If you apply both resistances and weaknesses against the same damage, cancel them out with each other and apply normal damage.

## Attack Options

When attacking, you have access to different options through weapon properties or combat maneuvers.

### Dual-wielding

While you are wielding two light melee weapons, you can attack with both of them in the same Action. Each weapon attack counts as its own attack, for which you can choose the same or different targets. You suffer +1 bane on these attacks.

### Attacking multiple targets

Some effects allow you to hit multiple targets with the same attack. For this, compare your roll to each target's Defense that would be hit. Your SL is calculated for each target individually. Inflict your normal damage on each target that you hit successfully.

## Improvised Weapons

When you donâ€™t have any real weapons handy, you may want to use any available objects as improvised weapons, such as tools or inventory.

Attacks with improvised weapons suffer +1 bane and deal damage based on their size. Improvised weapons all have the fragile property and a Durability die depending on their size.

| Improvised Weapon Size | Weapon Damage | Durability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| light | 2 | d4 |
| one-handed | 3 | d4 |
| two-handed | 4 | d6 |

## Attacking Objects

Sometimes you want to attack free-standing objects, such as to break into a door or cut the rope of a chandelier. When doing so, make a normal attack roll either in melee or at range against the object, provided you have any realistic chance of damaging the object with your chosen weapon (e.g. you canâ€™t smash a door by firing a normal arrow).

Objects have a Defense (counting for both Parry and Dodge), AV, and HP, the same as creatures. Once the HP are reduced to 0, the object is destroyed.

Refer to the table below to see what the statistics of any given object are.

| Object Type | Defense | AV | HP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rope | 12 | 0 | 5 |
| ceramic vase or pot | 10 | 2 (light) | 5 |
| wooden door or chest | 8 | 5 (light) | 10 |
| metal door or chest | 8 | 10 (heavy) | 20 |
| stone wall | 8 | 20 (heavy) | 40 |
