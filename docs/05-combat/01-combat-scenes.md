## Starting Combat

At the start of combat, first, determine if one or more groups involved are surprised (see below). After that, everyone rolls for Initiative!

### Surprise

Whenever one group of combatants tries to get the upper hand on their foes, roll for surprise.

**Surprising Enemies**

If you attempt to surprise your enemies at the start of combat, each participating adventurer rolls Agility + Stealth against each of the enemiesâ€™ Resist. An adventurer is considered hidden from all the enemies they succeeded against.

**Getting Surprised**

If enemies try to surprise the adventurers on the other hand, each of the enemies has to roll Agility + Stealth against each of the adventurersâ€™ Resist. An enemy is considered hidden from all adventurers they succeeded against.

### Initiative

When combat starts, all combatants roll Initiative (Agility/Spirit + Perception). This roll isnâ€™t made against a set Difficulty, but instead acts as a order in which all combatants will act. All combatants will act in descending order (highest to lowest result). Between adventurers and enemies with the same Initiative result, adventurers act before enemies.

The initiative order remains the same for all rounds of the combat scene, but can be changed by certain effects and abilities.

## Combat Turns

During combat, adventurers and enemies can use one of a variety of Actions on their turn. In addition, all combatants get 1 Movement on their turns, with which they can move one area.

You can also drop, sheathe, draw, or switch weapons or other carried items on your turn without taking an Action (within reason).

## Actions

The following actions are available to all combatants.

## Quick Actions

Quick Actions are small actions that take no more than a few seconds. They can also be quick reactive abilities outside of your turn during combat. Quick Actions always have triggers for when they can be used. You can use one Quick Action on your turn or between your turns. You regain access to your Quick Action at the end of each of your turns.
You can also always substitute an ability using a Quick Action on your turn by using your Action instead.
