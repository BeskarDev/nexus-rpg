# üå°Ô∏è Conditions

You can suffer various conditions during the game. Each condition inflicts different effects on you. When you suffer a condition, the source also states how long it holds effect. When you suffer the same condition multiple times, you only are effected by it once. In the case of conditions with different potencies, such as bleeding, you only suffer the most potent version of the condition.
