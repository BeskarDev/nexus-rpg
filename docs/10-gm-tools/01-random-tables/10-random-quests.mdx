# 📜 Quest Hooks

<QuestAutoRollerWrapper />

## Overview

Use this tool to generate random **rumors**, **quest hooks**, and **adventuring jobs** for your game. Select a category and party level, then roll to produce a ready-to-use adventure lead with appropriate reward scaling.

- **Rumor:** Vague hearsay — unverified, possibly exaggerated, and open to interpretation. Seeds player-driven exploration.
- **Quest Hook:** A confirmed problem posted publicly — on a notice board, announced by a crier, or declared at a temple.
- **Job:** A direct commission from a patron with a specific task and negotiated pay.

### How to Use

1. **Choose a category** — Rumor, Quest Hook, or Job.
2. **Set the party level** — determines reward scope, coin range, and treasure quality. Use "Random" for variety.
3. **Roll** — the generator fills all blanks from the tables below and calculates reward values.
4. **Add campaign detail** — replace abstract fragments with specific names, creatures, and places from your setting.

### Generating Multiple Leads

During a scene — an evening at an inn, a visit to the town square, or a meeting with a contact — generate several leads at once. Roll one of each category for three leads with different levels of detail and commitment. Mix tier brackets for variety:

- A **Local rumor** that seems minor but hints at something larger.
- A **Provincial quest hook** matching the party's power level.
- A **Regional job** that pays less but has a moral pull.

## Sentence Seeds

Each category uses a template sentence. The generator fills the blanks from the d66 tables below.

- **Rumor:** *"[Source] says that [rumor subject] near [location]. They say it's because of [cause]."*
- **Quest Hook:** *"Wanted: [task] [subject] at [location]. Warning: [complication]. Reward: [reward]."*
- **Job:** *"[Patron] wants you to [task] [subject] at [location], but [complication]. On success: [reward]."*

## Level Scaling

The party's level determines the scope of the adventure lead and the value of any reward.

| Party Level | Scope | Coin Reward | Treasure Quality | Travel Time |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1–2 | Local (village, neighbourhood) | 25–250 | Q1–Q3 | Hours |
| 3–4 | Regional (district, trade route) | 100–750 | Q2–Q4 | Days |
| 5–6 | Provincial (city-state, province) | 250–2,500 | Q3–Q5 | A week |
| 7–8 | National (kingdom, major faction) | 750–7,500 | Q4–Q6 | Weeks |
| 9–10 | Legendary (world-shaping, mythic) | 2,500–25,000 | Q5–Q7 | A season |

## Reward Modifiers

After assembling the seed, adjust the coin reward from the level-scaling table:

| Modifier | Adjustment |
|---|---|
| Time pressure | +25 % |
| High danger | +50 % |
| Wealthy patron | +25 % |
| Desperate patron | +50 %, risk of non-payment |
| Discreet work | +25 % |
| Moral complexity | +0 coin, add reputation or favour |

## Extending the Tables

Each table is a d66 grid (36 entries). To add new content:

1. Create a **themed variant** of any table — scoped to an environment, faction, or tone — and swap it in at the GM's discretion.
2. New variant tables use the same d66 grid format and follow the entry guidelines below.

### Entry Guidelines

- Name *types*, never specific names or places.
- Keep entries to a short phrase (2–5 words).
- Avoid geographic assumptions — "a water's edge" not "the harbour."
- Ensure any entry works when combined with any entry from another table.
- Match the ancient-world sword-and-sorcery tone.

## Examples

### Rumor Example

> **Seed:** *"A midwife says that people have been vanishing near a low-lying hollow. They say it's because of a bold predator."*
>
> **GM adds detail (Level 3, Regional):** The hollow is a seasonal flood basin a day's ride east. A pack of predators has grown aggressive since their territory shifted. Villagers offer 150 coins for proof the threat is dealt with.

### Quest Hook Example

> **Seed:** *"Wanted: track down a dangerous creature at a gathering place. Warning: a spy aids the enemy. Reward: coin payment — 500 coins (Q4 treasure, Provincial scope)."*
>
> **GM adds detail (Level 5, Provincial):** A monstrous predator has been attacking a seasonal market crossroads. Someone in the merchant camp is luring the beast to rival stalls. The provincial governor posts a 500-coin bounty.

### Job Example

> **Seed:** *"A guild master wants you to recover forbidden materials at ancient tunnels, but the employer is dishonest. On success: coin payment — 300 coins (Q3 treasure, Regional scope)."*
>
> **GM adds detail (Level 4, Regional):** An alchemist guild elder hires the party to retrieve reagents from tunnels beneath a collapsed workshop. She claims they are hers by right — in truth, they were confiscated by the city for being dangerous. She offers 300 coins but will deny involvement if the party is caught.
