# 🗣️ Social Intrigue

Use these tables to quickly generate the key social parameters for an NPC involved in a Social Intrigue scene. Roll once on each table or pick results that fit the situation. See the [Social Intrigue rules](../../06-scenes/08-social-intrigue.md) for full details on how these parameters work in play.

## NPC Disposition (Starting Interest Modifier)

Roll to determine the NPC's initial attitude toward the adventurers before the request is made. This gives an **Interest modifier** — combine it with the Request Alignment modifier below, then look up the result in the Interest table to find the effective TN modifier.

<RollableTable singleRoll>
| 2d6 | Disposition | Interest Modifier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Hateful | Breakdown (immediate refusal) |
| 3–4 | Hostile | −2 |
| 5–6 | Suspicious | −1 |
| 7–9 | Indifferent | +0 |
| 10–11 | Friendly | +1 |
| 12 | Intimate | +2 |
</RollableTable>

**Interest Levels** (sum of Disposition + Request Alignment modifiers):

| Total Modifier | Interest | TN Modifier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| −1 or lower | Resistant | +2 (or Breakdown if below −1) |
| 0 | Skeptical | +1 |
| +1 | Open | +0 |
| +2 | Receptive | −1 |
| +3 or higher | Eager | −2 |

## Request Alignment

Roll or choose how well the adventurers' request aligns with the NPC's interests. Apply this modifier to the starting Interest from Disposition above.

<RollableTable singleRoll>
| d6 | Request Alignment | Interest Modifier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1–2 | Opposed — directly against the NPC's goals or safety | −1 |
| 3–4 | Neutral — neither harms nor benefits the NPC | +0 |
| 5–6 | Aligned — directly serves the NPC's desires or values | +1 |
</RollableTable>

## Patience

Roll to determine how many exchanges the NPC will tolerate before making up their mind.

<RollableTable singleRoll>
| d6 | Patience | Die | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1–2 | Hurried | d4 | Busy merchant, nervous informant, impatient noble |
| 3–4 | Measured | d6 | Typical NPC with competing interests |
| 5–6 | Deliberate | d8 | Cautious official, slow-to-trust elder, careful conspirator |
</RollableTable>

## NPC Pitfalls

Roll once or twice to generate Pitfalls. Triggering a Pitfall reduces Interest by −1; if Interest drops below Resistant, the intrigue ends in a Breakdown.

<RollableTable>
| d12 | Pitfall | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | *Threat: Past crimes* | Implying you know something they want hidden — feels like blackmail |
| 2 | *Threat: Rival leverage* | Mentioning their rivals in a way that sounds like a threat or deal |
| 3 | *Insult: Underestimating them* | Suggesting the task is trivial, easy, or beneath their usual standard |
| 4 | *Insult: Doubting their word* | Questioning their honesty or asking for excessive guarantees |
| 5 | *Insult: Comparing unfavorably* | Naming someone else who could do the job better |
| 6 | *Taboo: Forbidden topic* | Raising a subject they consider deeply private, sacred, or shameful |
| 7 | *Taboo: Cultural violation* | Committing a gesture, phrase, or act that breaches local custom |
| 8 | *Rival: Hated faction* | Invoking the name of a group they despise, even innocently |
| 9 | *Rival: Personal enemy* | Associating the request with someone they have bad history with |
| 10 | *Fear trigger: Exposure* | Describing the plan in a way that emphasizes their legal or social risk |
| 11 | *Pride wound: Old failure* | Referencing a past mistake or defeat, however unintentionally |
| 12 | *Loyalty conflict: Prior oath* | The request conflicts with a promise or obligation they've already made |
</RollableTable>
