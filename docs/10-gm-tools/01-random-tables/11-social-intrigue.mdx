# 🗣️ Social Intrigue

Use these tables to quickly set up the social parameters for an NPC before or during a Social Intrigue scene. Roll once on each table or just pick what fits. See the [Social Intrigue rules](../../06-scenes/08-social-intrigue.md) for how these values work in play.

---

## NPC Disposition

Roll to find the NPC's initial attitude toward the adventurers. This is their **disposition modifier**, the starting point for Interest before the Request Alignment is added. The full disposition rules are in [NPCs and Relationships](../../02-adventurers/05-npc-relations.md).

<RollableTable singleRoll>
| 2d6 | Disposition | Modifier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Hateful | −3 (automatic refusal, no challenge) |
| 3–4 | Hostile | −2 |
| 5–6 | Suspicious | −1 |
| 7–9 | Indifferent | +0 |
| 10–11 | Friendly | +1 |
| 12 | Intimate | +2 |
</RollableTable>

---

## Request Alignment

Roll or choose how well the request fits the NPC's goals. Add this modifier to the Disposition result to get the **starting Interest**.

If starting Interest is −2 or lower, the NPC refuses outright; no challenge is needed.

<RollableTable singleRoll>
| d6 | Request Alignment | Modifier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1–2 | Opposed: directly against the NPC's goals or safety | −1 |
| 3–4 | Neutral: neither harms nor benefits the NPC | +0 |
| 5–6 | Aligned: directly serves the NPC's desires or values | +1 |
</RollableTable>

## Patience (Challenge Die)

Roll to set how long the NPC is willing to engage. This is the challenge die, and it advances on every roll (success or failure), so a small die means a short, pressured conversation.

<RollableTable singleRoll>
| d6 | Temperament | Challenge Die | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1–2 | Impatient | d4 | Busy merchant, nervous informant, flustered noble |
| 3–4 | Measured | d6 | Typical NPC with competing interests |
| 5–6 | Deliberate | d8 | Cautious official, slow-to-trust elder, careful conspirator |
</RollableTable>

## NPC Motivations

Roll twice to generate two distinct Motivations. Each one can be appealed to once per challenge for +1 Interest.

## NPC Pitfalls

Roll once or twice to generate Pitfalls. Triggering one lowers Interest by −1. If Interest reaches −2 or lower, the intrigue ends in a Breakdown.

<RollableTable>
| d20 | Pitfall | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | *Threat: Past crimes* | Implying you know something they want hidden, even subtly. It reads as blackmail |
| 2 | *Threat: Rival leverage* | Mentioning their rivals in a way that sounds like a deal or a warning |
| 3 | *Insult: Underestimating them* | Suggesting the task is easy or beneath their usual standard |
| 4 | *Insult: Doubting their word* | Questioning their honesty or asking for excessive proof |

| 10 | *Rival: Personal enemy* | Associating the request with someone they have bad history with |
| 11 | *Fear trigger: Exposure* | Describing the plan in a way that highlights their legal or social risk |
| 12 | *Pride wound: Old failure* | Referencing a past mistake or defeat, however unintentionally |
| 13 | *Loyalty conflict: Prior oath* | The request conflicts with a promise or obligation they've already made |
| 14 | *Overconfidence: Presuming agreement* | Acting as if the deal is done before they've committed to anything |

| 17 | *Unwanted witness: Unexpected company* | Bringing someone along the NPC didn't expect and doesn't trust |
| 18 | *Revealed alternatives: You tried someone else* | Letting slip that you approached another party before coming to them |
| 19 | *Uncomfortable truth: Pointing out their weakness* | Highlighting a vulnerability in a way that feels like gloating rather than honesty |
| 20 | *Social contract: Breaking an implicit rule* | Violating an unspoken expectation of the setting, such as speaking out of turn in a formal gathering |
