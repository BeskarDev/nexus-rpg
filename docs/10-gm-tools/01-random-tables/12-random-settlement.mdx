# 🏛️ Settlements

<SettlementAutoRollerWrapper />

## Overview

Use this tool to quickly generate settlements for your game. Select **Full Settlement** to roll on all tables at once, or pick individual categories to fill in specific details. Each roll produces a unique combination — reroll individual tables to swap out any result that doesn't fit.

### How to Use

1. **Choose a table** — "Full Settlement" rolls everything at once. Individual tables let you build a settlement piece by piece.
2. **Roll** — the generator picks a random entry from each table and formats it as a natural-language description.
3. **Combine and refine** — use the results as a starting point. Replace generic details with specific names, places, and factions from your campaign.
4. **Roll multiple times** — set the count higher to compare options or combine the best parts of several results.

### Tips for Building Settlements

- **Layer results.** Roll a full settlement, then roll individual tables again to add a second threat, another power player, or an extra district.
- **Combine across pages.** Pair settlement results with the [NPC generator](./11-social-intrigue.mdx) for key figures, or the [Quest Hooks generator](./10-random-quests.mdx) for local adventure leads.
- **Scale to size.** A village might only need Geography, Resources, and one Threat. A city could use every table rolled twice.
- **Reroll freely.** If two results clash, keep the one you like and reroll the other. The tables are designed for mix-and-match use.

## Examples

### Full Settlement Example

> **Generated:** *"A settlement in a sheltered valley between sandstone ridges. Its economy depends on olive groves and oil pressing. The people practice hospitality laws requiring strangers be sheltered for three days. Ruled by a council of merchant families who rotate leadership yearly. In the past, a golden age of trade and learning under a legendary ruler. Threatened by a rival settlement competing for the same water source. Defended by a trained citizen militia organized by neighborhood. Justice is handled by community justice where victims negotiate restitution directly. The most influential figure is a guild of artisans whose craft is vital to the local economy. Notable landmark: a great market square paved with colored stone from distant quarries. Features a sprawling market district with permanent stalls and covered bazaars. The streets are covered by fabric awnings stretched between rooftops for shade."*
>
> **GM refines:** A prosperous oil-trading town called Keshara sits in a valley between the Amber Ridges. The Olive Council — five merchant families — governs in annual rotation. The town's golden age ended when the neighboring settlement of Dur-Amash began diverting their shared river. Keshara's citizen militia drills weekly, but the real power lies with the Pressers' Guild, whose master negotiates trade deals the Council only rubber-stamps.

### Building a Settlement Piece by Piece

> Roll **Geography** first to set the physical foundation, then **Resources** to determine what the economy looks like. Add **Government** and **Culture** for social structure. Finally, roll **Threats** and **Power Players** to create tension. Each additional table adds a new layer — stop whenever you have enough detail for your session.
