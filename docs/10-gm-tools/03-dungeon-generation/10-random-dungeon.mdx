# 🏰 Random Dungeon Generation

This guide explains how to generate random dungeons using the **Cyclic Dungeon Generation** method, adapted for the Nexus RPG system.

:::info Credits
This method is based on *Cyclic Dungeon Generation v1.0* by **Sersa Victory**, which adapts the level creation algorithm from Joris Dormans's 2017 roguelite *Unexplored*.

## What Is Cyclic Dungeon Generation?

Cyclic dungeon generation creates dungeons composed of **cycles**—circular loops of linked rooms designed to create a specific gameplay flow. By nesting multiple cycles (such as "lock-and-key" or "hidden shortcut"), dungeons feel intentionally designed rather than randomly scattered.

> "Instead of just wandering at random, you quickly find that the path forward is blocked, forcing you to solve puzzles, find items and keys, and defeat enemies to continue. There's a huge variety of structure, all randomly generated, but nearly every level is a tightly packed, interesting space."

### Materials Needed

- Pencil and eraser
- Blank and graph paper
- Polyhedral dice
- Tables for features, monsters, traps, and treasure (see below and other GM Tools)

## Dungeon Configuration

Use this interactive tool to configure your dungeon and roll for cycle types:

## What Is a Cycle?

A **cycle** is a roughly circular loop of linked dungeon chambers that creates a certain gameplay flow (e.g., "lock-and-key"). By nesting cycles, you build a flowchart for an engaging non-linear dungeon.

Each cycle includes:

- **Start:** Beginning chamber (dungeon entrance or first room of a cluster)
- **Goal:** End chamber (reward, obstacle, exit, boss, or treasure)
- **Arcs:** Two paths from start to goal, representing routes through the dungeon
- **Insertion Points (♦):** Where sub-cycles can be inserted

## The Twelve Cycle Types

Each cycle type creates a distinct gameplay experience. Roll d12 or choose the one that fits your dungeon's theme.

<RollableTable>
| d12 | Cycle Type | Description |
|-----|------------|-------------|
| 1 | Two Alternative Paths | Two long paths lead to the same goal, each with different themes (e.g., monsters vs. traps). Both are equally challenging. |
| 2 | Two Keys | Two long paths lead to a locked goal room; each path contains a key that must be combined to open the lock. |
| 3 | Hidden Shortcut | A hidden passage shortcuts the main route. Players who explore carefully can bypass challenges. |
| 4 | Dangerous Route | A short, risky route exists alongside a longer, safer path. Risk-takers may take heavy damage or gain rewards. |
| 5 | Foreshadowing Loop | From the start, players can see or sense the goal but can't reach it directly. A long loop eventually leads there. |
| 6 | Lock-and-Key Cycle | A locked barrier blocks the goal. The key is found via a looping path that returns near the start. |
| 7 | Blocked Retreat | After crossing a threshold (pit, one-way door, collapse), players cannot return. They must complete the loop to escape. |
| 8 | Monster Patrol | A powerful monster patrols a circular route. Players must time their movement or find a way to defeat it. |
| 9 | Altered Return | The return path becomes more dangerous—new traps spring, monsters awaken, or the environment changes. |
| 10 | False Goal | A decoy goal is presented first. The true goal is hidden and requires additional exploration or clues. |
| 11 | Simple Lock-and-Key | A short path leads to a key, and a short path leads to the locked goal. The simplest cycle type. |
| 12 | Gambit | Near the goal, an optional side path leads to extra treasure behind a dangerous obstacle. High risk, high reward. |
</RollableTable>

## Locks and Keys

Many cycles require locks and keys. Roll on this table to determine the type:

<RollableTable>
| d6 | Lock and Key Type | Hard/Soft | Description |
|----|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Door lock and key | Hard | A physical door with a matching key hidden elsewhere. |
| 2 | Mechanism/NPC and key item | Hard | A lever, puzzle, or NPC that requires a specific item to activate. |
| 3 | Magical or environmental barrier | Hard | A force field, elemental wall, or enchanted obstruction requiring a magical counter. |
| 4 | Powerful monster and method to defeat/evade | Soft | A creature blocking the way that can be fought, bypassed, or distracted. |
| 5 | Deadly trap and method to disable/evade | Soft | A hazardous trap that can be disarmed, avoided, or survived. |
| 6 | Hazard and method to neutralize/evade | Soft | An environmental danger (poison gas, flooding) that can be countered or escaped. |
</RollableTable>

**Hard locks** require a specific key or solution—there's no alternative.  
**Soft locks** can be overcome through multiple approaches (combat, stealth, negotiation, etc.).

## Dungeon Scope Guidelines

### Tiny (Single Challenge)
- **1 cycle**
- A quick encounter or puzzle room
- Great for side content or a single scene
- 2-4 rooms

### Small (2-4 hours / One-Shot)
- **2-3 cycles**
- A compact dungeon for a single session
- Straightforward progression with a few interesting choices
- 6-12 rooms

### Medium (Few Sessions)
- **4-6 cycles**
- A multi-session dungeon with branching paths
- Multiple objectives and exploration opportunities
- 15-25 rooms

### Large (5-10 Sessions)
- **7-10 cycles**
- A significant dungeon complex with multiple wings
- Includes factions, sub-goals, and varied environments
- 30-50 rooms

### Huge (Mega-Dungeon / Campaign)
- **10+ cycles, multiple levels**
- An entire campaign location
- Multiple themes, factions, and long-term mysteries
- 50+ rooms across multiple levels

## Dungeon Rank Guidelines

Match the dungeon's difficulty to your party's level:

| Dungeon Rank | Creature Tiers | Trap TN | Treasure Quality | Notes |
|--------------|----------------|---------|------------------|-------|
| 1-2 | Tier 0-2 | TN 6-8 | Q1-Q2 | Straightforward challenges, forgiving traps |
| 3-4 | Tier 2-4 | TN 8-10 | Q2-Q4 | Tactical complexity, moderate danger |
| 5-6 | Tier 4-6 | TN 10-12 | Q4-Q6 | Elite enemies, multi-phase encounters |
| 7-8 | Tier 6-8 | TN 12-14 | Q5-Q7 | Powerful magic, legendary foes |
| 9-10 | Tier 8-10 | TN 14-16 | Q6-Q8 | Pinnacle of mortal challenge |

## Step-by-Step Generation Process

1. **Choose Dungeon Rank** — Match to your party's level
2. **Choose Dungeon Scope** — How long should exploration take?
3. **Roll Starting Cycle** — Use the cycle type roller above
4. **Add Sub-Cycles** — Nest additional cycles at insertion points
5. **Determine Locks and Keys** — What blocks progress? What opens the way?
6. **Populate Rooms** — Use the dressing tables and creature tables
7. **Place Treasure** — Distribute rewards using the treasure tables
8. **Draw the Map** — Translate your flowchart into a physical layout

### Tips for Nesting Cycles

- Start with your **main cycle** (the overall dungeon structure)
- Add **sub-cycles** at insertion points to create complexity
- Each wing or level can be its own cycle
- More cycles = more exploration time
- Balance cycle complexity with session length

## Example: Quick One-Shot Dungeon

**Rank 3 | Small Scope | 2 cycles**

1. **Main Cycle: Lock-and-Key (rolled 6)**
   - Entrance leads to locked door
   - Loop through side passages to find key
   - Return to unlock and reach goal

2. **Sub-Cycle: Gambit (rolled 12)**
   - Near the goal, optional dangerous path
   - Extra treasure behind monster guardian

3. **Lock Type: Magical barrier (rolled 3)**
   - Enchanted door requires dispelling or key crystal

4. **Dressing: Temple + Runic inscriptions**
   - Ancient cult temple with glowing wards
   - Wards trigger if disturbed incorrectly

5. **Faction: Cultist cell (rolled 2)**
   - Small group performing ritual in inner chamber
   - May negotiate or fight depending on approach

This creates a roughly 8-room dungeon playable in one session!
