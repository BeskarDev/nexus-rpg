## **Mummy Lord's Tomb** (Lair)

The ancient tomb of a Mummy Lord is a place of dark power, filled with cursed treasures, deadly traps, and the accumulated necromantic energy of millennia. The very walls seem to pulse with malevolent life, and the air itself weighs heavy with the curse of undeath.

### **Lair Passive Effects**

When fighting a Mummy Lord in its tomb, the following effects are always active:

- **Cursed Ground.** All healing effects are reduced by half (rounded down). Living creatures that finish a rest in the tomb do not regain HP or recover from conditions.
- **Oppressive Darkness.** Light sources have their range reduced by one category. Magical light cannot exceed dim light intensity within the tomb.
- **Whispers of the Dead.** At the start of each living creature's turn, they must roll Spirit + Fortitude vs. TN 10 or suffer frightened until the end of their turn. Creatures that succeed are immune to this effect for the rest of the scene.
- **Sapping Sands.** Moving through areas of loose sand or debris (GM's discretion) costs +1 Movement. The Mummy Lord and other undead are immune to this effect.

### **Lair Actions**

On initiative count 20 (losing ties), the Mummy Lord can take one of the following lair actions:

- **Animate Guardians.** The Mummy Lord animates 1d4 skeletal guardians that emerge from sarcophagi or wall reliefs. These use Skeleton (Humanoid) statistics and act immediately after this lair action. They crumble to dust at the end of the scene.

- **Sandstorm Surge.** A whirlwind of cursed sand fills the tomb. All creatures except the Mummy Lord must roll Agility + Athletics vs. TN 11 or be blinded until the end of their next turn. The area is heavily obscured until the start of the next lair action.

- **Tomb Collapse.** The Mummy Lord causes part of the ceiling to collapse. Choose one area within long range. All creatures in that area must roll Agility + Athletics vs. TN 12 or take 8 crush damage and fall prone. The area becomes difficult terrain.

- **Curse of Binding.** The Mummy Lord targets one creature within medium range. That creature must roll Spirit + Fortitude vs. TN 13 or be restrained by spectral bandages until the end of their next turn. While restrained this way, the creature takes 4 necrotic damage at the start of their turn.

- **Pharaoh's Wrath.** Ancient hieroglyphs on the walls glow with malevolent energy. All living creatures in the tomb must roll Mind + Fortitude vs. TN 11 or suffer confused until the end of their next turn as visions of the Mummy Lord's past glory overwhelm their minds.
