# üêé Mounts & Companions

![banner-img](/img/banner/mounts-companions-banner.png)
You can ride a creature that is suitable as a mount and one or more Sizes above you. A flying mount has to be at least two Sizes above you. While mounted, you can move with your mount‚Äôs Movement during your turn. You also travel faster (1.5x travel speed) and Fortitude rolls during travel only affect your mount and not you.

When you need to attempt difficult riding maneuvers, roll Agility + Nature to guide your mount.

Your mount is no active combatant during combat unless it is also a companion (see below). Creatures that are smaller than your mount suffer +1 bane on attacks against you, while mounted.

You also have to roll Spirit + Nature in situations that scare or confuse your mount. The difficulty of this roll depends on the intensity of the situation. Failing the roll inflicts the confused condition on your mount. After failing, you can re-attempt your roll at the start of your turns. The following situations force you to make this roll:

- Your mount takes damage.
- A loud noise erupts.
- Your mount is close to an undead or otherwise supernatural creature.

## Feeding Mounts

Mounts and animal companions require regular feeding to remain healthy and functional. The rules for feeding are intentionally streamlined to avoid excessive bookkeeping while maintaining a sense of resource management.

**Daily Feeding**

Each mount or animal companion must be fed once per day during travel or adventure. Feeding a mount requires one of the following:

- **1 use of animal feed** (if using purchased feed bags)
- **Foraging during travel** (roll Spirit + Nature or Spirit + Survival vs. TN 8 during a travel day; success provides enough forage for one mount)
- **Access to natural grazing** (when camped in grasslands, forests, or other suitable terrain for at least a medium duration, mounts can graze freely without requiring a roll or resources)

**Effects of Not Feeding**

If a mount goes unfed for a full day, it suffers one Fatigue at the end of that day. Mounts that have suffered Fatigue from lack of food cannot recover that Fatigue until properly fed for at least one day. Mounts reduced to 0 HP from starvation-induced Fatigue become too weak to carry riders or loads until they recover.

**Water**

Mounts also require water daily. In most temperate environments, water is assumed to be available from streams, wells, or carried waterskins. In desert or arid regions, water becomes a critical resource. Mounts denied water for a full day also suffer one Fatigue, following the same rules as lack of food.

## Mount Equipment

Mounts can be outfitted with various types of equipment to improve their utility and protection. Each piece of equipment takes up load on the mount and may provide specific benefits.

### Saddles

Saddles make riding more comfortable and secure, and provide attachment points for carrying gear.

**Standard Saddle** (Quality 2, 3 load, 50 coins)
- Provides comfortable seating for one rider

### Barding (Mount Armor)

- Does not reduce mount's Movement

## Mount Options

Different types of mounts offer varying capabilities, from carrying capacity to speed and special abilities. The following represents common mount options available in most civilized regions. Their statistics can be found in the Companion Traits section below if they can also serve as companions.

### Common Mounts

| Mount Type | Tier | Size | Base Carrying Capacity | Movement | Special Traits | Typical Cost |

| **Draft Horse** | 2 | Large | 25 load | 1/turn (1x travel) | Strong; +2 to carrying capacity limits | 75 coins |
| **War Horse** | 3 | Large | 20 load + rider | 2/turn (2x travel) | Trained for combat; can attack in battle | 750 coins |
| **Camel** | 2 | Large | 20 load + rider | 1/turn (1.5x travel) | Desert adapted; requires half water in arid climates | 250 coins |

| **Ox** | 2 | Large | 30 load | 1/turn (0.5x travel) | Slow but incredibly strong; best for wagons | 100 coins |

**Notes on Carrying Capacity:**
- Carrying capacity includes the weight of any saddle, barding, or equipment on the mount
- Mounts become encumbered following the same rules as adventurers when exceeding their carrying capacity
- The "Beast of Burden" ability (found on horses, mules, etc.) adds +2 to the mount's encumbrance and over-encumbrance limits
- A rider's personal load does not count against carrying capacity unless the mount is also carrying significant cargo

### Mount Special Abilities

Many mounts have special abilities detailed in their creature entries. Here are common abilities:

**Fast Movement** - Mount has +1 Movement per turn and can travel at increased speed (typically 2x normal travel speed)

**Beast of Burden** - Add +2 to the mount's encumbrance and over-encumbrance limits, allowing it to carry more before becoming slowed

**Powerful Build** - Similar to Beast of Burden; some creatures have inherent strength for carrying loads

**Amphibious/Aquatic** - Mount can swim effectively or hold breath for extended periods

**Climbing** - Mount can scale walls or difficult terrain (like giant lizards)

**Desert Adapted** - Mount requires less water in arid environments (like camels)

**Combat Training** - Mount can act as a companion in combat, making attacks and using abilities

## Companions

Companions are powerful NPCs that accompany you on your adventures. You can obtain access to various NPC companions - bestial, humanoid, or other.

For example, adventurers wanting an Animal Companion will have to take the Survival Talent with the same name. 

### Companions during combat

Every companion is assigned to one specific adventurer, who guides and leads them. The companion takes their turn during combat either directly before or after their assigned adventurer (your choice).

**Health**

The companion has two Health Marks. When they are reduced to 0 HP, they start suffering Wounds or Fatigue the same way as an adventurer. The only difference is, that when they have taken two Wounds, they are instantly dead. If they suffered one Wound and one Fatigue, they instead start dying the same as adventurers.

**Morale**

Companions aren't as battle-hardened as adventurers and need to roll Spirit + Fortitude to hold their morale in tough situations. The following situations require your companion to roll for morale during combat:

- The companion is engaged with an enemy 2 or more tiers above them.
- The companion takes a Wound or Fatigue.
- You fall unconscious, start dying, or are dead.
- The number of enemies the companion is engaged with is two times or more than the number of allies (also counting the companion itself).
