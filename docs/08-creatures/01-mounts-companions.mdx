# 🐎 Mounts & Companions

![banner-img](/img/banner/mounts-companions-banner.png))

Mounts and companions can greatly enhance your adventuring capabilities, providing transportation, combat support, and specialized abilities. While mounts serve primarily as transportation, companions are loyal allies who fight alongside you. Both require care and attention to maintain their effectiveness.

> The feeding and care rules below apply to both mounts and companions. For brevity, the text refers to "mounts" but the same rules govern all animal companions.

## Feeding & Care

Each mount or companion that requires food must be fed once per day during a night's rest. You have several options:

- **Animal Feed:** Roll a Supply check for animal feed appropriate to the creature's diet (herbivore, carnivore, or omnivore).
- **Foraging:** Forage for appropriate food during travel.
- **Natural Grazing/Hunting:** Rest at a location with access to natural grazing (herbivores) or huntable prey (carnivores).

Mounts and companions suffer Fatigue and become deprived the same way adventurers do from lack of food and water.

**Special Companions:** Some companions don't require food or water at all. Undead companions have no need for sustenance, elementals draw energy from their native planes, and certain aberrations may have unusual metabolisms. Always check a companion's Diet trait—if it lists "None," the creature requires no feeding.

## Mounts

You can ride a creature that is suitable as a mount and one or more Sizes above you. A flying mount has to be at least two Sizes above you. While mounted, you can move with your mount's Movement during your turn. You also travel faster (1.5x travel speed) and Fortitude rolls during travel only affect your mount and not you.

When you need to attempt difficult riding maneuvers, roll Agility + Nature to guide your mount.

Your mount is no active combatant during combat unless it is also a companion (see below). Creatures that are smaller than your mount suffer +1 bane on attacks against you, while mounted.

You also have to roll Spirit + Nature in situations that scare or confuse your mount. The difficulty of this roll depends on the intensity of the situation. Failing the roll inflicts the confused condition on your mount. After failing, you can re-attempt your roll at the start of your turns. The following situations force you to make this roll:

- Your mount takes damage.
- A loud noise erupts.
- Your mount is close to an undead or otherwise supernatural creature.

### Common Mounts

For the full list of available mounts, see the [Mounts](./01-mounts-companions/mounts) page.

### Mount Equipment

For the different kinds of mount equipment available, see the [Mount Equipment](./01-mounts-companions/equipment) page.

## Companions

Companions are powerful NPCs that accompany you on your adventures. You can obtain access to various NPC companions - bestial, humanoid, or other.

For example, adventurers wanting an Animal Companion will have to take the Survival Talent with the same name.

### Obtaining a Companion

To have a companion accompany you, you first need the ability to command and bond with one. This typically comes from:

- **Talents and Features:** Certain talents (like Animal Companion) or class features grant you the ability to bond with and command a companion.
- **Spells:** Some spells can summon temporary companions for limited durations.

Once you have the ability to bond with a companion (through a talent, feature, or similar), you can obtain one through the following methods:

- **Purchase:** Buy a trained companion from specialized trainers or merchants. See the table below for costs by tier.
- **Taming:** Attempt to tame a wild creature yourself. This requires successful Spirit + Nature rolls over time (typically a medium to long duration depending on the creature's tier and temperament). The GM determines the difficulty and duration required.
- **Other Methods:** Your GM may allow other methods based on your story, such as rescuing a creature, earning one as a reward, or forming a bond through roleplay.

> Having the ability to bond with a companion (from a talent or feature) and actually obtaining a specific companion are two separate steps. You need both the mechanical ability and an in-world method of acquisition.

### Trained Companion Costs

If you want to purchase a companion at character creation or during the game, use the following costs based on the companion's tier:

| Tier | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| 0 (Harmless) | 25 coins |
| 1 (Capable) | 75 coins |
| 2 (Dangerous) | 250 coins |
| 3 (Ferocious) | 750 coins |
| 4 (Monstrous) | 2,500 coins |
| 5 (Primeval) | 7,500 coins |

### Companions during combat

Every companion is assigned to one specific adventurer, who guides and leads them. The companion takes their turn during combat either directly before or after their assigned adventurer (your choice).

**Health**

The companion has two Health Marks. When they are reduced to 0 HP, they start suffering Wounds or Fatigue the same way as an adventurer. The only difference is, that when they have taken two Wounds, they are instantly dead. If they suffered one Wound and one Fatigue, they instead start dying the same as adventurers.

**Morale**

Companions aren't as battle-hardened as adventurers and need to roll Spirit + Fortitude to hold their morale in tough situations. The following situations require your companion to roll for morale during combat:

- The companion is engaged with an enemy 2 or more tiers above them.
- The companion takes a Wound or Fatigue.
- You fall unconscious, start dying, or are dead.
- The number of enemies the companion is engaged with is two times or more than the number of allies (also counting the companion itself).
