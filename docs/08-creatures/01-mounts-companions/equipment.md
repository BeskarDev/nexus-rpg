## Mount Equipment

### Saddles

Saddles function similarly to backpacks for adventurers. If a mount has a saddle, it takes up 0 load on the mount and provides additional carrying capacity.

| Quality | Saddle Type | Load | Cost | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Riding Pad** | 0 | 15 coins | Simple blanket or hide providing minimal comfort. Can hold up to 2 load in small attached pouches. |
| 1 | **Pack Saddle** | 0 | 30 coins | Designed for cargo rather than riding. Cannot be ridden while equipped. Adds +5 to the mount's carry capacity limits. |
| 2 | **Standard Saddle** | 0 | 50 coins | Provides comfortable seating for one rider. Includes saddlebags that can hold up to 5 load. Grants +1 boon on Agility + Nature rolls to maintain control during difficult maneuvers. |
| 3 | **Exotic Saddle** | 0 | 125 coins | Custom-fitted for non-standard mounts (flying creatures, unusual anatomy, etc.). Required for safely riding such creatures. Adds +4 to the mount's carry capacity limits. |
| 3 | **War Saddle** | 0 | 150 coins | Reinforced saddle for combat. Includes reinforced saddlebags that can hold up to 8 load. Grants +1 boon on Agility + Nature rolls to maintain control during combat. Provides +1 to the rider's Parry defense while mounted. |

### Barding (Mount Armor)

Barding protects mounts in combat but adds significant weight.

| Quality | Barding Type | Load | Cost | AV Bonus | Special |
