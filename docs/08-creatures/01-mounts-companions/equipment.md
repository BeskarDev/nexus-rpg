## Mount Equipment

### Saddles

| 1 | **Pack Saddle** | 0 | 30 coins | Designed for cargo rather than riding. Cannot be ridden while equipped. Adds +6 to the mount's carry capacity. |
| 2 | **Standard Saddle** | 0 | 50 coins | Provides comfortable seating for one rider, including saddlebags. |
| 3 | **Exotic Saddle** | 0 | 125 coins | Custom-fitted for non-standard mounts (flying creatures, unusual anatomy, etc.). Required for safely riding such creatures. |
| 3 | **War Saddle** | 0 | 150 coins | Reinforced saddle for combat, inncluding reinforced saddlebags. Adds +4 to the mount's carry capacity. Grants +1 boon on Agility + Nature rolls to maintain control during difficult maneuvers. |

### Barding (Mount Armor)

Barding protects mounts in combat but adds significant weight.
