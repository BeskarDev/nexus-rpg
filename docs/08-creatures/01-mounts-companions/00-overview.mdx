# 🐎 Mounts & Companions

![banner-img](/img/banner/mounts-companions-banner.png)

Mounts and companions can greatly enhance your adventuring capabilities, providing transportation, combat support, and specialized abilities. While mounts serve primarily as transportation, companions are loyal allies who fight alongside you. Both require care and attention to maintain their effectiveness.

> The feeding and care rules below apply to both mounts and companions. For brevity, the text refers to "mounts" but the same rules govern all animal companions.

## Feeding & Care

Each mount or companion that requires food must be fed once per day during a night's rest. You have several options:

- **Animal Feed:** Roll a Supply check for animal feed appropriate to the creature's diet (herbivore, carnivore, or omnivore).
- **Foraging:** Forage for appropriate food during travel.
- **Natural Grazing/Hunting:** Rest at a location with access to natural grazing (herbivores) or huntable prey (carnivores).

Mounts and companions suffer Fatigue and become deprived the same way adventurers do from lack of food and water. 

**Special Companions:** Some companions don't require food or water at all. Undead companions have no need for sustenance, elementals draw energy from their native planes, and certain aberrations may have unusual metabolisms. Always check a companion's Diet trait—if it lists "None," the creature requires no feeding.
