# 📜 Creature Rules

Creatures act in the same basic ways, as adventurers do. But some details differ:

- Spell-casting creatures don’t use Focus for their spells. Instead, they are limited in their use of individual spells. They can only cast each spell once. After they have cast each spell once, they regain their single use of each spell again.
- Creature attacks or abilities refer to different groups of combatants with the following meanings.
  - “Creature”: refers to the creatures themselves.
  - “Creatures”: refers to all creatures, regardless of allegiance.
  - “Allies”: refers to all other creatures aligned with the creature.
  - “Opponents”: refers to the adventurers, their allies, as well as other creature groups that are opposed to the creature and their allies.

## Creature Categories

Creatures can come in different categories representing their importance and power level.

### Basic

The most simple type of creature you encounter in almost every combat. They are goons who die quickly and can't do too much. But beware them in great numbers.

Basic creatures…

- can only take one Wound and instantly die from one Injury.
- can’t spend Resolve.
- have to roll for Morale if things go bad for them.
- can combine with their allies into troops.

**Morale**

When the tide of battle turns against them, they need to roll Spirit + Fortitude to hold their morale. The following situations require creatures to roll for morale:

- The number of creatures is reduced below half their original size.
- All elite or master creatures are dead or otherwise removed from the fight.

**Troops**

Larger numbers of the same type of basic creature can also be grouped into troops. Typically three or more creatures with the same statistics and equipment should be grouped into a troop.

For this, treat the whole troop as one creature using the members statistics and the following rules:

- **HP.** Track the normal HP of one of the troop’s members and reduce it with any damage against the troop. Whenever the troop’s HP is reduced to 0, one of it’s members dies and their HP are reset to the maximum, being further reduced by any excess damage. Large amounts of damage from a single attack can also take out multiple of the troop’s members if it exceeds the troop’s HP multiple times.
The troop is disbanded once their size is reduced to two or less.
- **Area of Effect.** For **e**ffects that target multiple members of the troop, treat each member as a single creature. Damage applied to multiple members is added together and applied to the troop as a whole. When applying conditions or other lasting effects, split the original troop into two new troops (if enough members remain) between those affected and those that are not affected.

> **Example: Attacking a troop**
The adventurers face a troop of five goblins. The troop has 10 HP and 2 AV, the same as a single goblin. One of the adventurers attacks the troop with a cleave attack, targeting three of it’s members. They hit and deal 13 damage to each target. The goblin troop’s 2 AV reduces this to 11 damage per target and therefore 33 damage in total against the troop itself. From this damage, three goblins in the troop die and a third loses 3 HP. Since the troop has less than three members left, the GM immediately rolls for Morale to see, if the two remaining goblins flee or continue the fight as single creatures**.**
>
- **Targeting.** When choosing a target, all members of the troop choose the same target. You can split the original troop into multiple troops (if enough members remain) when you want to split the troop up for multiple targets.
- **Troop Bonus.** This bonus is equal to half the troop size (rounded down).
- **Rolling Tests.** Roll only once for the entire troop. If the members have ranks in the skill they roll with, add the troop bonus instead of that skill rank to the result.
- **Dealing Damage.** Roll a single attack for the entire troop using the rules above. Troops don’t use the normal rules for dealing damage. Instead, the troop deals damage according to the SL of the roll:
  - **Blunder.** No damage.
  - **Failure.** (Base Damage + Weapon Damage) x Troop Bonus
  - **Weak.** (Base Damage + Weapon Damage) x (1 + Troop Bonus)
  - **Strong.** (Base Damage + Weapon Damage) x (2 + Troop Bonus)
  - **Critical.** (Base Damage + Weapon Damage) x (3 + Troop Bonus)

    Any other abilities or effects that increase the damage of the troop are added only once to the total damage dealt.

> **Example: Getting attacked by a troop**
A troop of five goblin warriors attacks you with their daggers (2 weapon damage). They roll their attack with 1d8 (Agility) + 1d6 + 2 (troop bonus). Based on the SL, they deal the following amount of damage:

- **Blunder.** No damage.
- **Failure.** 12 damage. ([4 base + 2 weapon] x 2)
- **Weak.** 18 damage. ([4 base + 2 weapon] x 3)
- **Strong.** 24 damage. ([4 base + 2 weapon] x 4)
- **Critical.** 30 damage. ([4 base + 2 weapon] x 5)
>

### Elite

Few and far between you will encounter the elite among creatures.

Elite creatures…

- can take up to two Wounds. When they suffer their first Wound, they regain all of their HP (this can't be negated).
- If they start dying, they automatically die at the end of the scene.
- can’t spend Resolve.
- have to roll for Morale, but gain +1 boon on it.

### Master

Master creatures are the highlight of a whole adventure. They are often the powerful leader of an entire faction of creatures.

Master creatures…

- can take a number of Wounds equal to the number of adventurers fighting them (min. 3). When they suffer a Wound, they regain all of their HP (this can't be negated).
- once they take a Wound, they recover from all negative conditions and effects that previously affected them.
- If they start dying, they automatically die at the end of the scene.
- when they succeed on a roll to withstand or recover from any condition, they are immune to that type of condition for the rest of the scene.
- don’t have to roll for Morale.

## Size

While adventurers are generally small or medium sized, there are a variety of other-sized creatures from tiny to colossal:

| Size Category | Modifier | Example Creatures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tiny | -2 | house cat |
| Small | -1 | domesticated dog |
| Medium | +0 | wolf |
| Large | +1 | horse |
| Huge | +2 | mountain giant |
| Gargantuan | +3 | fully-grown dragon |
| Colossal | +4 | dragon turtle |

Each size categories modifier influences several of the creatures statistics (see below)

### Big creatures in melee combat

While tiny to huge creatures are handled by the normal rules for distances and when you can attack creatures in melee, creatures bigger than that are an exception. Each creature of these size categories has the following rules applied to them:

**Gargantuan (+3).** This creature fills up an entire area.

- Other creatures can’t enter this creatures area, unless they grapple onto it or roll some other form of test to pass.
- Creatures in adjacent areas are considered close to this creature. They can choose to get into melee range, as if they were in the same area with it.
- When determining any other range category, treat any of the adjacent areas of this creature as the maximum distance you have to cover.

**Colossal (+4).** This creature fills up multiple areas.

- This creature takes up the area it is in, as well as all adjacent areas. It is considered to be within any of those areas at the same time.
- Other creatures can’t enter this creatures areas, unless they grapple onto it or roll some other form of test to pass.
- Creatures in adjacent areas to any of this creatures areas are considered close to this creature. They can choose to get into melee range, as if they were in the same area with it.
- When determining any other range category, treat any of the adjacent areas of any of this creatures areas as the maximum distance you have to cover.

## Building a Creature

Each creature's power level is separated into six tiers corresponding to the six tiers of adventuring difficulty. Their statistics have a general range that should be followed for each tier. If a creature has one statistic of a higher tier, it should balance out with another statistic from a lower tier.

|  | Tier 0 (trivial) | Tier 1 (common) | Tier 2 (strong) | Tier 3 (powerful) | Tier 4 (epic) | Tier 5 (legendary) | Tier 6 (mythical) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hit Points | 1-10 | 10-20 | 20-40 | 30-60 | 40-80 | 50-100 | 60-120 |
| Primary Attribute | d6 | d8 | d10 | d12 | d12+1 | d12+2 | d12+3 |
| Defenses | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 |
| AV | 0-2 | 2-4 | 3-6 | 4-8 | 5-10 | 6-12 | 7-14 |
| Weapon Damage | 1-2 | 2-4 | 4-6 | 6-9 | 8-12 | 10-15 | 12-18 |
| Skill Rank | 0 / 0 | 0 / 1 | 1 / 2 | 2 / 3 | 3 / 4 | 4 / 5 | 5 / 5 |
| Ability Difficulty | Trivial (4) | Easy (6) | Moderate (8) | Hard (10) | Very Hard (12) | Extreme (14) | Legendary (16) |

### Calculating creature statistics

- **Hit Points.** Choose a creatures HP based on it’s Tier and if it generally frail or sturdy.
You don’t have to choose the minimum or maximum HP for a creature’s tier, but can also choose a more nuanced value in between. Although, you should always keep a creature’s HP divisible by 10 to focus on meaningful differences and simplify the math.
- **Primary Attribute.** Choose which of the four attributes (Strength, Agility, Spirit, or Mind) is the creature’s primary characteristic. Set that attribute to a d6 + increased by one dice step for each of it’s Tier. The other attributes should generally be one, two, and three dice steps below the primary attribute respectively.
- **Defenses.** The average Defense of a creature is 7 + it’s Tier. You can increase and decrease the individual Defenses, but should always keep the average at that value and not increase or decrease any single Defense more than 2 below or above the average.
  - Larger creatures add their Size modifier to Parry but subtract it from Dodge.
  - Smaller creatures add their Size modifier to Dodge but subtract it from Parry.
- **AV.** Choose if the creature absorbs little or a lot of damage based on it’s natural armor or any worn pieces of armor. The result should be equal to it’s Tier + 1 (low) or 2 x (Tier + 1) (high).
- **Weapon Damage.** Most damaging attacks for a creature should use 1/2 their primary attribute as the base damage. Then decide if the creature generally deals low or high damage and assign their attacks a fitting weapon damage (which multiplies with increased SL). The weapon damage for a creature can be calculated with 2 x it’s Tier (low) or 3 x it’s Tier (high).
  - For more nuanced attack options, you can also calculate the total damage the creature should deal and divide the total into multiple, less powerful attacks.
  - Attacks hitting multiple targets should also generally deal only half the creature’s total damage to any target.
  - You can also increase the creature’s base damage by reducing their weapon damage accordingly. Keep in mind, that generally a critical hit from a creature should deal no more than twice the total damage of a weak hit.
- **Skill Rank.** The creature’s combat or magic skills should be equal to their Tier - 1. All other skills the creature has reasonably learned should be equal to their Tier.
- **Ability Difficulty.** Any of the creature’s abilities should have a Difficulty of TN 4 + 2 x it’s Tier.

## Creature Units

- Infantry (low damage, low health, medium mobility)
- Ranged (medium damage, low health, medium mobility)
- Brute (high damage, high health, low mobility)
- Cavalry (medium damage, low health, high mobility)
- Artillery (high damage, medium health, low mobility)

| Unit | Damage | Health | Mobility | Range | Numbers | Tactic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Infantry | low | low | medium | short | high | strength in numbers, block enemy movement |
| Ranged | low | low | medium | long | high | attack from flanks, high places, or safe distance |
| Brute | high | high | slow | short | few | advancing into melee, or guarding allies |
| Cavalry | medium | low | high | short | some | fast attack from flanks |
| Artillery | high | medium | low | medium | few | area of effect attacks, or controlling effects |
| Spawner | low | medium | low | medium | few | summon more and more allies |
| Elie/Boss | high | high | high | medium | singular | combine multiple unit types |

## Creatures with multiple parts

Some creatures consist of multiple parts. Either because of their sheer size, because it is an object with multiple parts, or a unit consisting of multiple creatures, such as a rider and their mount.

Each individual part has its own HP, Defenses, and attacks. A creature can target a specific part of such a creature or object with an attack but suffers +1 bane on the roll. Once a part is brought to 0 HP, it is considered disabled and the creature suffers a Wound from it (if it is a vital part). A disabled part no longer contributes its attacks and abilities to the entire creature or object.

An example is targeting a large dragon's wings to bring it down to the ground.

When the adventurers first encounter or start combat with a creature or object with multiple parts, the GM informs them about all available parts as targets.

## Looting Equipment from Creatures

Adventurers might want to add the equipment of fallen creatures to their own arsenal. With few exceptions, equipment from fallen creatures is always damaged, as a result of bad maintenance, or from the damage they suffered in the fight before. You can repair the Equipment during a rest, to return them to full strength.
