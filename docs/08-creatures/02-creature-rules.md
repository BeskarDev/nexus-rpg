# 📜 Creature Rules

# Creature Rules

Creatures act in the same basic ways, as adventurers do. But some details differ:

- Spell-casting creatures don’t use Focus for their spells. Instead, they are limited in their use of individual spells. They can only cast each spell once. After they have cast each spell once, they regain their single use of each spell again.
- Creature attacks or abilities refer to different groups of combatants with the following meanings.
    - “Creature”: refers to the creatures themselves.
    - “Creatures”: refers to all creatures, regardless of allegiance.
    - “Allies”: refers to all other creatures aligned with the creature.
    - “Opponents”: refers to the adventurers, their allies, as well as other creature groups that are opposed to the creature and their allies.

## Creature Categories

Creatures can come in different categories representing their importance and power level. 

### Basic

The most simple type of creature you encounter in almost every combat. They are goons who die quickly and can't do too much. But beware them in great numbers.

Basic creatures…

- can only take one Wound and instantly die from one Injury.
- can’t spend Resolve.
- have to roll for Morale if things go bad for them.
- can combine with their allies into troops.

**Morale**

When the tide of battle turns against them, they need to roll Spirit + Fortitude to hold their morale. The following situations require creatures to roll for morale:

- The number of creatures is reduced below half their original size.
- All elite or master creatures are dead or otherwise removed from the fight.

**Troops**

Larger numbers of the same type of basic creature can also be grouped into troops. Typically three or more creatures with the same statistics should be grouped into a troop.

For this, treat the whole troop as one creature. The troop retains all of the normal statistics of the creature type. Whenever an attack’s damage is equal to or higher than the troop's HP, one of its members dies. This can also mean that a large amount of damage from a single attack can take out multiple members of the troop at once. Should the number of members be reduced below three, treat the remaining creatures as single combatants instead and immediately roll for morale for them.

The troop can also be targeted by attacks and other effects that affect multiple enemies. For this, treat each affected member of the troop as a single creature but apply the total damage to the entire troop. If the effect applies conditions or other effects on only a fraction of the troop, treat them as two separate troops between those creatures affected and those that are not.

> For example, the adventurers face a troop of five goblins. The troop has 10 HP and 2 AV, the same as a single goblin. One of the adventurers attacks the troop with a cleave attack, targeting three of it’s members. They hit and deal 13 damage to each target. The goblin troop’s 2 AV reduces this to 11 damage per target and therefore 33 damage in total against the troop itself. From this damage, three goblins in the troop die and a third loses 3 HP. Since the troop has less than three members left, the GM immediately rolls for Morale to see, if the two remaining goblins flee or continue the fight as single creatures**.**
> 

When the troop rolls for a test which its members have ranks in the skill for, they don‘t use that skill rank, but instead add a bonus equal to half of the size of the troop (rounded up). On a successful attack, they add the same bonus multiplied by their SL to the damage.

> For example, the same troop of five goblin warriors attacks with their daggers. They roll their attack with 1d8 (Agility) + 1d6 + 3 (half troop size, rounded up). On a weak hit, they deal 9 damage (4 base + 2 weapon + 3 troop). A strong hit would deal 14 damage (4 base + 2*2 weapon + 2*3 troop) and a critical hit 19 damage (4 base + 3*2 weapon + 3*3 troop).
> 

Troops always choose the same target(s) with their attacks and abilities. The troop size can also dynamically adjust for different targets. For this, choose how many creatures target each individual creature and treat the troop size accordingly for rolls that target that creature.

In situations, in which a subset of members of a troop is affected by some effect, treat them as their own separated troop. For example, when an adventurer uses their Quick Action to evade one of the troop members’ attacks, the evaded member is treated separately for attacking.

> In short, when grouping multiple creatures into a troop:
- One of the troop members dies whenever they take damage equal to their HP (damage from a single attack can kill multiple troop members)
- Apply damage to multiple troop members against the whole troop
- Disband the troop, once their numbers are reduced below three
- Roll for trained skills with half of the size of the troop (rounded up) instead of their skill rank
- Add damage equal to half of the size of the troop (rounded up) multiplied by the SL of their attack
> 

### Elite

Few and far between you will encounter the elite among creatures. 

Elite creatures…

- can take up to two Wounds. When they suffer their first Wound, they regain all of their HP.
- If they start dying, they automatically die at the end of the scene.
- can’t spend Resolve.
- have to roll for Morale, but gain +1 boon on it.

### Master

Master creatures are the highlight of a whole adventure. They are often the powerful leader of an entire faction of creatures.

Master creatures…

- can take a number of Wounds equal to the number of adventurers fighting them (min. 3). When they suffer a Wound, they regain all of their HP.
- If they start dying, they automatically die at the end of the scene.
- once they take a Wound, they recover from all negative conditions and effects that previously affected them.
- when they succeed on a roll to withstand or recover from any condition, they are immune to that condition for the rest of the scene.
- can spend Resolve to re-roll any test. They gain a fixed amount of Resolve per scene, usually between 1 and 3 depending on their tier.
- don’t have to roll for Morale.
- take one extra turn at extremely slow Initiative.

## Building a Creature

Each creature's power level is separated into six tiers corresponding to the six tiers of adventuring difficulty. Their statistics have a general range that should be followed for each tier. If a creature has one statistic of a higher tier, it should balance out with another statistic from a lower tier.

|  | Tier 0 (trivial) | Tier 1 (common) | Tier 2 (strong) | Tier 3 (powerful) | Tier 4 (epic) | Tier 5 (legendary) | Tier 6 (mythical) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hit Points | 5-10 | 10-20 | 20-30 | 30-40 | 40-60 | 60-80 | 80-100 |
| Primary Attribute | d6 | d8 | d10 | d12 | d12 | d12 | d12 |
| Defenses | 8 / 7 / 6 | 9 / 8 / 7 | 10 / 9 / 8 | 11 / 10 / 9 | 12 / 11 / 10 | 13 / 12 / 11 | 14 / 13 / 12 |
| AV | 0 | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 |
| Damage | 3-4 | 4-6 | 6-12 | 12-18 | 18-24 | 24-30 | 30-36 |
| Skill Rank (Combat / Other) | 0 / 0 | 0 / 1 | 1 / 2 | 2 / 3 | 3 / 4 | 4 / 5 | 5 / 5 |
| Ability Difficulty | Easy (6) | Easy (6) | Moderate (8) | Hard (10) | Very Hard (12) | Extremely Hard (14) | Nearly Impossible (16) |

### Calculating creature statistics

- **Hit Points.** Choose if the creature leans towards being physically weak or strong. Pick the lower or higher number of HP for their tier respectively.
- **Primary Attribute.** Choose which of the four attributes (Strength, Agility, Spirit, or Mind) is the creature’s primary characteristic. Set that attribute to the given die size for their tier. The other three attributes can only be of a lower die size than the primary one.
- **Defenses.** Decide on what the creature’s good, normal, and bad Defenses are (Parry, Dodge, or Resist). Generally, stronger creatures have good Parry, nimble creatures have good Dodge and wise or aware creatures have good Resist. Match the three given values for their tier accordingly (or choose a normal Defense for each) and add or subtract their Size modifier as described below.
    - Larger creatures subtract their Size modifier from Dodge.
    - Smaller creatures add their Size modifier to Dodge.
- **AV.** Choose an appropriate AV based on the natural hardiness of the creature’s body and add any bonuses or penalties they might get from their size or equipped items. The total result should not exceed the given value for their tier.
- **Damage.** Determine the base damage of the creature’s attacks based on whether their attacks use force (1/2 Strength), swiftness (1/2 Agility), willpower (1/2 Spirit), or wits (1/2 Mind). If they wield a weapon, use its base damage instead.
    - The added weapon or spell damage should result in the attack’s damage falling into the given range for their tier on a weak hit.
    - Strong or critical hits should never result in an amount of damage double its normal amount. If they would, choose a slightly lower weapon or spell damage.
    - When using a normal weapon on a larger enemy, increase the weapon damage by +1 for each size category above medium.
- **Skill Rank.** For the creature’s combat skill, choose the appropriate way for the creature to fight. If they attack at melee (Fighting), keep a distance (Archery), or even sling spells or other magical effects (Arcana/Mysticism). Allocate the skill rank for their tier to that skill. If the creature’s associated attribute for combat is higher than their tier, consider reducing their combat skill rank by 1 for each die step above their tier.
They may also have ranks in other skills that fit into their identity. These skills should all be of the same rank, depending on the creature‘s tier.
- **************************************Ability Difficulty.************************************** Use this difficulty for any rolls that adventurers have to make as a response to the creature‘s attacks and abilities.

### Quickly improving an existing creature

When the GM quickly needs to alter the difficulty of any type of creature. For each tier above or below their original one, the same kind of creature should get… 

- +/- 10 HP
- +/- 2 AV
- +/- 1 on each Defense
- +/- 1 step on Attributes
- +/- 2 weapon damage
- +/- 1 Skill Rank

## Creature Units

- Infantry (low damage, low health, medium mobility)
- Ranged (medium damage, low health, medium mobility)
- Brute (high damage, high health, low mobility)
- Cavalry (medium damage, low health, high mobility)
- Artillery (high damage, medium health, low mobility)

| Unit | Damage | Health | Mobility | Range | Numbers | Tactic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Infantry | low | low | medium | short | high | strength in numbers, block enemy movement |
| Ranged | low | low | medium | long | high | attack from flanks, high places, or safe distance |
| Brute | high | high | slow | short | few | advancing into melee, or guarding allies |
| Cavalry | medium | low | high | short | some | fast attack from flanks |
| Artillery | high | medium | low | medium | few | area of effect attacks, or controlling effects |
| Spawner | low | medium | low | medium | few | summon more and more allies |
| Elie/Boss | high | high | high | medium | singular | combine multiple unit types |

## Creatures with multiple parts

Some creatures consist of multiple parts. Either because of their sheer size, because it is an object with multiple parts, or a unit consisting of multiple creatures, such as a rider and their mount.

Each individual part has its own HP, Defenses, and attacks. A creature can target a specific part of such a creature or object with an attack but suffers +1 bane on the roll. Once a part is brought to 0 HP, it is considered disabled and the creature suffers a Wound from it (if it is a vital part). A disabled part no longer contributes its attacks and abilities to the entire creature or object.

An example is targeting a large dragon's wings to bring it down to the ground.

When the adventurers first encounter or start combat with a creature or object with multiple parts, the GM informs them about all available parts as targets. 

## Looting Equipment from Creatures

Adventurers might want to add the equipment of fallen creatures to their own arsenal. With few exceptions, equipment from fallen creatures is always damaged, as a result of bad maintenance, or from the damage they suffered in the fight before. You can repair the Equipment during a rest, to return them to full strength.
