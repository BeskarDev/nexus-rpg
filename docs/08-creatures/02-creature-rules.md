# 📜 Creature Rules

![banner-img](/img/banner/creature-rules-banner.png)

Creatures act in the same basic ways, as adventurers do. But some details differ:

- Spell-casting creatures don’t use Focus for their spells. Instead, they are limited in their use of individual spells. They can only cast each spell once. After they have cast each spell once, they regain their single use of each spell again.
- Creature attacks or abilities refer to different groups of combatants with the following meanings.
    - “Creature”: refers to the creatures themselves.
    - “Creatures”: refers to all creatures, regardless of allegiance.
    - “Allies”: refers to all other creatures aligned with the creature.
    - “Opponents”: refers to the adventurers, their allies, as well as other creature groups that are opposed to the creature and their allies.

## Creature Categories

Creatures can come in different categories representing their importance and power level. 

### Basic

The most simple type of creature you encounter in almost every combat. They are goons who die quickly and can't do too much. But beware them in great numbers.

Basic creatures…

- can only take one Wound and instantly die from one Injury.
- can’t spend Resolve.
- have to roll for Morale if things go bad for them.
- can combine with their allies into troops.

**Morale**

When the tide of battle turns against them, they need to roll Spirit + Fortitude to hold their morale. The following situations require creatures to roll for morale:

- The number of creatures is reduced below half their original size.
- All elite or master creatures are dead or otherwise removed from the fight.

**Troops**

Larger numbers of the same type of basic creature can also be grouped into troops. Typically three or more creatures with the same statistics and equipment should be grouped into a troop.

For this, treat the whole troop as one creature using the members statistics and the following rules:

- **HP.** Track the normal HP of one of the troop’s members and reduce it with any damage against the troop. Whenever the troop’s HP is reduced to 0, one of it’s members dies and their HP are reset to the maximum, being further reduced by any excess damage. Large amounts of damage from a single attack can also take out multiple of the troop’s members if it exceeds the troop’s HP multiple times.
The troop is disbanded once their size is reduced to two or less.
- **Area of Effect.** For **e**ffects that target multiple members of the troop, treat each member as a single creature. Damage applied to multiple members is added together and applied to the troop as a whole. When applying conditions or other lasting effects, split the original troop into two new troops (if enough members remain) between those affected and those that are not affected.

> **Example: Attacking a troop<br/>**
The adventurers face a troop of five goblins. The troop has 10 HP and 2 AV, the same as a single goblin. One of the adventurers attacks the troop with a cleave attack, targeting three of it’s members. They hit and deal 13 damage to each target. The goblin troop’s 2 AV reduces this to 11 damage per target and therefore 33 damage in total against the troop itself. From this damage, three goblins in the troop die and a third loses 3 HP. Since the troop has less than three members left, the GM immediately rolls for Morale to see, if the two remaining goblins flee or continue the fight as single creatures**.**
> 
- **Targeting.** When choosing a target, all members of the troop choose the same target. You can split the original troop into multiple troops (if enough members remain) when you want to split the troop up for multiple targets.
- **Troop Bonus.** This bonus is equal to half the troop size (rounded down).
- **Rolling Tests.** Roll only once for the entire troop. If the members have ranks in the skill they roll with, add the troop bonus instead of that skill rank to the result.
- **Dealing Damage.** Roll a single attack for the entire troop using the rules above. Troops don’t use the normal rules for dealing damage. Instead, the troop deals damage according to the SL of the roll:
    - **Blunder.** No damage.
    - **Failure.** (Base Damage + Weapon Damage) x Troop Bonus
    - **Weak.** (Base Damage + Weapon Damage) x (1 + Troop Bonus)
    - **Strong.** (Base Damage + Weapon Damage) x (2 + Troop Bonus)
    - **Critical.** (Base Damage + Weapon Damage) x (3 + Troop Bonus)
    
    Any other abilities or effects that increase the damage of the troop are added only once to the total damage dealt.
    

> **Example: Getting attacked by a troop<br/>**
A troop of five goblin warriors attacks you with their daggers (2 weapon damage). They roll their attack with 1d8 (Agility) + 1d6 + 2 (troop bonus). Based on the SL, they deal the following amount of damage:
- **Blunder.** No damage.
- **Failure.** 12 damage. ([4 base + 2 weapon] x 2)
- **Weak.** 18 damage. ([4 base + 2 weapon] x 3)
- **Strong.** 24 damage. ([4 base + 2 weapon] x 4)
- **Critical.** 30 damage. ([4 base + 2 weapon] x 5)
> 

### Elite

Few and far between you will encounter the elite among creatures. 

Elite creatures…

- can take up to two Wounds. When they suffer their first Wound, they regain all of their HP (this can't be negated).
- If they start dying, they automatically die at the end of the scene.
- can’t spend Resolve.
- have to roll for Morale, but gain +1 boon on it.

### Master

Master creatures are the highlight of a whole adventure. They are often the powerful leader of an entire faction of creatures.

Master creatures…

- can take a number of Wounds equal to the number of adventurers fighting them (min. 3). When they suffer a Wound, they regain all of their HP (this can't be negated).
- once they take a Wound, they recover from all negative conditions and effects that previously affected them.
- If they start dying, they automatically die at the end of the scene.
- when they succeed on a roll to withstand or recover from any condition, they are immune to that type of condition for the rest of the scene.
- don’t have to roll for Morale.

## Size

While adventurers are generally small or medium sized, there are a variety of other-sized creatures from tiny to colossal:

| Size Category | Modifier | Example Creatures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tiny | -2 | house cat |
| Small | -1 | domesticated dog |
| Medium | +0 | wolf |
| Large | +1 | horse |
| Huge | +2 | mountain giant |
| Colossal | +3 | fully-grown dragon |
| Gargantuan | +4 | dragon turtle |

Each size categories modifier influences several of the creatures statistics (see below)

### Big creatures in melee combat

While tiny to huge creatures are handled by the normal rules for distances and when you can attack creatures in melee, creatures bigger than that are an exception. Each creature of these size categories has the following rules applied to them:

**Colossal (+3).** This creature fills up an entire area.

- Other creatures can’t enter this creatures area, unless they grapple onto it or roll some other form of test to pass.
- Creatures in adjacent areas are considered close to this creature. They can choose to get into melee range, as if they were in the same area with it.
- When determining any other range category, treat any of the adjacent areas of this creature as the maximum distance you have to cover.

**Gargantuan (+4).** This creature fills up multiple areas.

- This creature takes up the area it is in, as well as all adjacent areas. It is considered to be within any of those areas at the same time.
- Other creatures can’t enter this creatures areas, unless they grapple onto it or roll some other form of test to pass.
- Creatures in adjacent areas to any of this creatures areas are considered close to this creature. They can choose to get into melee range, as if they were in the same area with it.
- When determining any other range category, treat any of the adjacent areas of any of this creatures areas as the maximum distance you have to cover.

## Building a Creature

Each creature's power level is separated into ten tiers corresponding to the ten levels adventurers can advance in experience. As not all creatures are the same of course, balance out higher-tier statistics with lower-tier ones so the creature balances out at their intended tier.

> A single creature of any Tier should be a decent challenge for a single adventurer of the same Level. But kepp in mind that special abilities and the number of combatants on either side will strongly influence this baseline of challenge. The GM should always use their inutition when determining the appropriate degree of challenge an enemy encounter should have for the adventuring group.

|  | HP | AV (Light / Heavy) | Defense | Max. Attribute | Skill Rank (1st / 2nd) | Weapon Damage | Ability Difficulty |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 0 | 5 | 0 / 1 | 6 | d6 | 0 / 0 | 2 | TN 6 |
| Tier 1 | 10 | 1 / 2 | 7 | d6 | 0 / 1 | 3 | TN 7 |
| Tier 2 | 20 | 2 / 4 | 8 | d8 | 1 / 1 | 4 | TN 8 |
| Tier 3 | 30 | 3 / 6 | 9 | d8 | 1 / 2 | 5 | TN 9 |
| Tier 4 | 40 | 4 / 8 | 10 | d10 | 2 / 2 | 6 | TN 10 |
| Tier 5 | 50 | 5 / 10 | 11 | d10 | 2 / 3 | 7 | TN 11 |
| Tier 6 | 60 | 6 / 12 | 12 | d12 | 3 / 3 | 8 | TN 12 |
| Tier 7 | 70 | 7 / 14 | 13 | d12 | 3 / 4 | 9 | TN 13 |
| Tier 8 | 80 | 8 / 16 | 14 | d12+1 | 4 / 4 | 10 | TN 14 |
| Tier 9 | 90 | 9 / 18 | 15 | d12+2 | 4 / 5 | 11 | TN 15 |
| Tier 10 | 100 | 10 / 20 | 16 | d12+3 | 5 / 5 | 12 | TN 16 |

### Calculating creature statistics

- **Hit Points.** Choose a creatures HP based on it’s Tier. A more frail or sturdy creature should have HP from a lower or higher tier respectively. This decision can be made by the creature‘s Size or other physical traits.
- **AV.** A creature’s base AV should be equal to it’s Tier or double it‘s tier for Heavy armor (a hard shell, full metal armor, etc.). Different modifiers also affect the creature’s AV:
    - Larger creatures should have AV from one Tier higher.
    - Smaller creatures should have AV from one Tier lower.
- **Defenses.** The base Defense of a creature is 6 + it’s Tier. You can increase and decrease the values of individual Defenses but should always keep the average at the creature‘s Tier. When adjusting individual Defenses in Tier, you should stay within two steps from it‘s original Tier, as to not make the much too low or too high.
    - Larger creatures should take Parry from one or two steps above their Tier and Dodge from one or two tier below it (one tier for large or huge, two tiers for gargantuan or colossal).
    - Smaller creatures should take Dodge from one or two steps above their Tier and Parry from one or two tier below it (one tier for small, two tiers for tiny).
- **Max. Attribute.** Choose which of the four attributes (Strength, Agility, Spirit, or Mind) is the creature’s primary characteristic. Set that attribute to the denoted max. attribute value and the other three to values below that.
- **Skill Rank.** The creature‘s skill ranks between their primary skills (arcana, archery, fighting, and mysticism) and secondary skills (all other) should reflect the two values denoted by their Tier. Creatures with an even Tier have all of their skills at 1/2 their Tier, whereas creatures with an odd Tier have 1/2 their Tier - 1 for their primary attributes and 1/2 their Tier for their secondary attributes.
- **Weapon Damage.** Most damaging attacks for a creature should use 1/2 their primary attribute as the base damage. Their weapon or spell damage should then be equal to their Tier + 2. Keep in mind that this value is multiplied by the SL of their attacks and any other attacks that don‘t use the default damage formula, should reflect roughly the same range of damage output.
    - Attacks hitting multiple targets should deal only half the creature’s total damage to it’s targets.
- **Ability Difficulty.** Whenever the creature uses abilities that forces their targets to roll instead, the Difficulty of that roll should be 6 + the creature‘s Tier.

## Creatures with multiple parts

Some creatures consist of multiple parts. Either because of their sheer size, because it is an object with multiple parts, or a unit consisting of multiple creatures, such as a rider and their mount.

Each individual part has its own HP, Defenses, and attacks. A creature can target a specific part of such a creature or object with an attack but suffers +1 bane on the roll. Once a part is brought to 0 HP, it is considered disabled and the creature suffers a Wound from it (if it is a vital part). A disabled part no longer contributes its attacks and abilities to the entire creature or object.

An example is targeting a large dragon's wings to bring it down to the ground.

When the adventurers first encounter or start combat with a creature or object with multiple parts, the GM informs them about all available parts as targets. 

## Looting Equipment from Creatures

Adventurers might want to add the equipment of fallen creatures to their own arsenal. With few exceptions, equipment from fallen creatures is always damaged, as a result of bad maintenance, or from the damage they suffered in the fight before. You can repair the Equipment during a rest, to return them to full strength.
