# üêé Mounts & Companions

## Mounts

You can ride a creature that is suitable as a mount and one or more sizes above you. While mounted, you can move with your mount‚Äôs Movement during your turn. You also travel faster (1.5x travel speed) and Fortitude rolls during travel only affect your mount and not you.

When you need to attempt difficult riding maneuvers, roll Agility + Nature to guide your mount.

Your mount is no active combatant during combat unless it is also a companion (see below). Creatures that are smaller than your mount suffer +1 bane on attacks against you, while mounted.

You also have to roll Spirit + Nature in situations that scare or confuse your mount. The difficulty of this roll depends on the intensity of the situation. Failing the roll inflicts the confused condition on your mount. After failing, you can re-attempt your roll at the start of your turns. The following situations force you to make this roll:

- Your mount takes damage.
- A loud noise erupts.
- Your mount is close to an undead or otherwise supernatural creature.

## Companions

Companions are powerful NPCs that accompany you on your adventures. You can obtain access to various NPC companions - bestial, humanoid, or other.

For example, adventurers wanting an Animal Companion will have to take the Survival Talent with the same name. 

### Companions during combat

Every companion is assigned to one specific adventurer, who guides and leads them. The companion takes their turn during combat either directly before or after their assigned adventurer (your choice).

**Health**

The companion has two Health Marks. When they are reduced to 0 HP, they start suffering Wounds or Fatigue the same way as an adventurer. The only difference is, that when they have taken two Wounds, they are instantly dead. If they suffered one Wound and one Fatigue, they instead start dying the same as adventurers.

**Morale**

Companions aren't as battle-hardened as adventurers and need to roll Spirit + Fortitude to hold their morale in tough situations. The following situations require your companion to roll for morale during combat:

- The companion is engaged with an enemy 2 or more tiers above them.
- The companion takes a Wound or Fatigue.
- You fall unconscious, start dying, or are dead.
- The number of enemies the companion is engaged with is two times or more than the number of allies (also counting the companion itself).

## Riding an animal companion

Some animal companions are large enough and have the anatomy to be ridable. When fighting while riding an animal companion, you share your companion‚Äòs movement with them during your turns. You can still both take actions on your individual turns.
