# 🐻 Creatures

The following sections contain creature stat blocks for use by the GM. A creature stat block contains all the information necessary to run a creature as a character.

For how to create your own creatures, see [Creature Rules](../02-creature-rules.md).

## Creature Tiers

Creatures are organized by tier, representing their power level and appropriate challenge for adventurers:

### [Tier 0](./tier-0)
**Challenge Level**: Novice adventurers (Level 0-1)  
**Examples**: Common animals, weak undead, minor pests

Tier 0 creatures represent the weakest opponents - common animals, small vermin, and basic threats. They're suitable challenges for beginning adventurers or can be used in swarms for higher-level parties.

### [Tier 1](./tier-1)
**Challenge Level**: Beginning adventurers (Level 1-2)  
**Examples**: Zombies, wolves, goblins, small elementals

Tier 1 creatures provide a meaningful challenge to starting adventurers. They include weak undead, common predators, lesser humanoids, and minor magical beings.

### [Tier 2](./tier-2)
**Challenge Level**: Experienced adventurers (Level 2-4)  
**Examples**: Ghouls, bears, ogres, medium elementals

Tier 2 creatures are dangerous opponents for early adventurers. They include more powerful undead, large predators, brutish humanoids, and competent spellcasters.

### [Tier 3](./tier-3)
**Challenge Level**: Veteran adventurers (Level 4-6)  
**Examples**: Mummies, trolls, elite warriors, powerful elementals

Tier 3 creatures pose serious threats even to experienced parties. They include ancient undead, monstrous creatures, elite combatants, and dangerous magical beings.

### [Tier 4](./tier-4)
**Challenge Level**: Expert adventurers (Level 6-8)  
**Examples**: Vampires, giants, master warriors, greater daimons

Tier 4 creatures are fearsome opponents requiring tactical coordination to defeat. They include powerful undead lords, massive creatures, legendary warriors, and major supernatural entities.

### [Tier 5](./tier-5)
**Challenge Level**: Legendary adventurers (Level 8-10)  
**Examples**: Ancient liches, dragons, demigods, primordial beings

Tier 5 creatures represent the pinnacle of mortal-scale threats. They include the most powerful undead, legendary beasts, epic heroes turned villains, and near-divine entities.

## Using Creatures

### Basic vs. Elite vs. Lord

- **Basic**: Standard creatures with one life pool, suitable for individual encounters or minions
- **Elite**: Tougher creatures with two life pools (2×HP), providing mid-boss challenges
- **Lord**: Major threats with three life pools (3×HP), designed as climactic encounters

### Encounter Building

A single creature of a given tier should provide a decent challenge for one adventurer of the same level. Adjust numbers based on:

- **Party size**: More adventurers need more creatures
- **Creature category**: Elite and Lord creatures are worth multiple basic creatures
- **Terrain and tactics**: Environmental factors can shift difficulty significantly
- **Party resources**: Fresh parties handle more than exhausted ones

Browse the tiers above to find creatures appropriate for your adventure!
