# 🐻 Creatures

The following sections contain creature stat blocks for use by the GM. A creature stat block contains all the information necessary to run a creature as a character.

For how to create your own creatures, see [Creature Rules](../02-creature-rules.md).

## Creature Tiers

Creatures are organized by tier (0-10), representing their power level and appropriate challenge for adventurers. Each tier corresponds to a character level, making encounter balance straightforward.

### [Tier 0](./tier-0)
**Challenge Level**: Novice adventurers (Level 0)  
**Examples**: Small animals, vermin, harmless wildlife

Tier 0 creatures represent the weakest opponents - small animals, vermin, and basic threats. They're suitable challenges for completely inexperienced adventurers or can be used in large numbers for higher-level parties.

### [Tier 1](./tier-1)
**Challenge Level**: Beginning adventurers (Level 1)  
**Examples**: Wolves, giant rats, basic skeletons, goblins

Tier 1 creatures provide a meaningful challenge to starting adventurers. They include common predators, basic undead, and lesser humanoid warriors.

### [Tier 2](./tier-2)
**Challenge Level**: Novice adventurers (Level 2)  
**Examples**: Zombies, small elementals, orcs, wild boars

Tier 2 creatures are slightly more dangerous, including stronger undead, minor magical beings, and organized humanoid fighters.

### [Tier 3](./tier-3)
**Challenge Level**: Trained adventurers (Level 3)  
**Examples**: Ghouls, dire wolves, ogres, veterans

Tier 3 creatures represent meaningful threats. They include more powerful undead, large predators, and experienced combatants.

### [Tier 4](./tier-4)
**Challenge Level**: Experienced adventurers (Level 4)  
**Examples**: Large elementals, trolls, gladiators, wyverns

Tier 4 creatures are formidable opponents requiring tactical thinking. They include dangerous beasts, regenerating giants, and elite fighters.

### [Tier 5](./tier-5)
**Challenge Level**: Skilled adventurers (Level 5)  
**Examples**: Mummies, manticores, sorcerers, young dragons

Tier 5 creatures pose serious threats. They include ancient undead, powerful monstrosities, and dangerous spellcasters.

### [Tier 6](./tier-6)
**Challenge Level**: Veteran adventurers (Level 6)  
**Examples**: Vampires, chimeras, warlords, adult dragons

Tier 6 creatures are fearsome opponents. They include powerful undead lords, legendary beasts, and military commanders.

### [Tier 7](./tier-7)
**Challenge Level**: Expert adventurers (Level 7)  
**Examples**: Giants, hydras, archmages, greater daimons

Tier 7 creatures require coordinated party tactics to defeat. They include massive giants, multi-headed monsters, and master spellcasters.

### [Tier 8](./tier-8)
**Challenge Level**: Master adventurers (Level 8)  
**Examples**: Liches, elder dragons, demon lords, titan spawn

Tier 8 creatures are among the most dangerous beings. They include undying sorcerer-kings, ancient dragons, and demonic nobility.

### [Tier 9](./tier-9)
**Challenge Level**: Legendary adventurers (Level 9)  
**Examples**: Ancient wyrms, primordial spirits, archliches

Tier 9 creatures represent near-mythical threats. They include the oldest dragons, elemental lords, and transcendent undead.

### [Tier 10](./tier-10)
**Challenge Level**: Epic adventurers (Level 10)  
**Examples**: Tarrasque, primordial titans, ancient wyrm dragons, godlike entities

Tier 10 creatures are the pinnacle of mortal-scale threats - legendary beings that reshape the world around them. Encounters with these creatures are campaign-defining events.

## Using Creatures

### Basic vs. Elite vs. Lord

- **Basic**: Standard creatures with one life pool, suitable for individual encounters or minions
- **Elite**: Tougher creatures with two life pools (2×HP), providing mid-boss challenges
- **Lord**: Major threats with three life pools (3×HP), designed as climactic encounters

### Encounter Building

A single creature of a given tier should provide a decent challenge for one adventurer of the same level. Adjust numbers based on:

- **Party size**: More adventurers need more creatures
- **Creature category**: Elite and Lord creatures are worth multiple basic creatures
- **Terrain and tactics**: Environmental factors can shift difficulty significantly
- **Party resources**: Fresh parties handle more than exhausted ones

Browse the tiers above to find creatures appropriate for your adventure!
