# Talent System Analysis

**Analysis of 115 talents against archetype instructions and talent creation guidelines**

## Executive Summary

**Current State:** 58% combat / 22% utility / 19% hybrid across 16 skills (4-14 talents per skill)

**Critical Gaps:**
- **4 skills severely under-represented:** Insight (4), Streetwise (4), Influence (5), Perception (5)
- **3 identity tags completely missing:** Infiltration, Whip control, Zone control
- **Key archetypes lacking support:** Oracle, Bard, Tamer, Hoplite, Warlock, Rogue
- **Design aspects below targets:** Defensive-Redirection (0%), Travel (3%), Defensive-Avoidance (5%)

**Recommendation:** Add 35-50 talents in 3 phases targeting critical skill gaps, archetype mechanics, and design balance.

- **Alchemy** (1) - Apothecary needs actual alchemy, not generic construction
- **Prophecy** (3) - Oracle needs dedicated prophecy system
- **Curses** (2) - Warlock needs curse-casting mechanics

### Design Aspect Deficits

| Aspect | Current | Target | Gap | Impact |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|--------|
| Defensive - Redirection | 0% | 10% | -10% | No talents redirect attacks |
| Utility - Travel | 3% | 15% | -12% | Violates "all skills need travel talents" guideline |
| Defensive - Avoidance | 5% | 15% | -10% | Limited dodge/evasion beyond Athletics |
| Utility - Exploration | 8% | 15% | -7% | Weak exploration support |
| Inter-Skill Synergies | 10% | 20% | -10% | Few talents reward multi-skill builds |

## 4. Implementation Roadmap

### Short-Term (Immediate)

**Actions:**
1. Add 4-6 talents each to Insight, Streetwise, Influence, Perception
2. Create talents for missing identity tags (Infiltration, Whip, Zone control)
3. Add music/performance talents for Bard

**Expected Outcome:** 20 new talents, eliminate completely missing tags

### Medium-Term (3-6 months)

**Goal:** Support under-served archetypes

**Actions:**
1. Implement archetype packages for Oracle, Bard, Tamer, Hoplite, Warlock
2. Add utility talents to Archery, Athletics, Perception
3. Expand defensive variety across all skills

**Expected Outcome:** 15-20 new talents, robust archetype support

### Long-Term (6-12 months)

**Goal:** Achieve target distributions

**Actions:**
1. Balance all skills to 8-12 talents
2. Ensure all design aspects meet 15%+ targets
3. Create talent progression paths within each skill

**Expected Outcome:** 145-160 total talents, balanced system

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Minimum talents per skill | 4 | 8 | ❌ |
| Skills lacking utility | 3 | 0 | ❌ |
| Missing identity tags | 3 | 0 | ❌ |
| Travel talent % | 3% | 15% | ❌ |
| Defensive - Redirection % | 0% | 10% | ❌ |
| Defensive - Avoidance % | 5% | 15% | ❌ |
| Exploration % | 8% | 15% | ⚠️ |
| Inter-skill synergies % | 10% | 20% | ⚠️ |

## 5. Design Principles

All new talents must adhere to talent creation guidelines:

✅ **Clear triggers, effects, and limits** - No vague narrative effects  
✅ **Skill-internal diversity** - Combat, utility, AND downtime options per skill  
✅ **Create synergies** - Intra-playstyle, inter-skill, or team-based  
✅ **Bounded power** - Rank 5 = mortal pinnacle, no reality-breaking  
✅ **Defined bonus types** - Prevent stacking abuse  
✅ **Fit skill themes** - Each skill has 4-5 theme pillars  

**Rank Progression:** Unlock (1) → Payoff (2) → Mastery (3) → Mythic (4-5)
