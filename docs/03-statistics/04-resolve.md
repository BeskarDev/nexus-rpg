# âœ¨ Resolve

Resolve represents the adventurer's tenacity, divine favour, and will to fight on. You can have a maximum of 3 Resolve at any point and can spend it at any time. 

Spend 1 Resolve to:

- re-roll the result of one test and take the new result
- regain 1/2 your max. HP on your turn (only once per scene)
- regain 1/2 your max. Focus on your turn (only once per scene)

You regain Resolve through certain actions and decisions:

- Regain 1 or more Resolve at the start of an adventure through your lifestyle during downtime (comfortable: 1, wealthy: 2, rich: 3)
- Regain 1 Resolve after a comfortable rest without interruptions
- The GM should grant every adventurer +1 Resolve during a scene where they come up with an especially creative solution (only once per gaming session)

> You only regain Resolve if you had less remaining. For example, when regaining 1 Resolve after a comfortable rest, you only do so, if you had 0 Resolve left. The exception to this is Resolve granted by the GM in a scene, which is instead added to your total Resolve (max. 3).
