# âœ¨ Resolve

Resolve is a resource that represents the adventurer's tenacity, luck, and will to fight on. You can have a maximum of 3 Resolve at any point and can spend it at different points of time to gain an advantage or get back up on your feet.

Spend 1 Resolve to

- re-roll the result of one test and take the new result
- automatically succeed on any roll to end one condition you suffer
- regain 1/2 your max. HP on your turn (once per combat)
- regain 1/2 your max. Focus during a short break

You can also spend all your remaining Resolve when you start dying to instead only fall unconscious.

You gain Resolve through different means

- At the start of an adventure, after 4 or more weeks of downtime, the adventurer gains Resolve according to the lifestyle they maintained during that downtime (comfortable: 1, wealthy: 2, rich: 3).
- After an offering to a god during downtime, gain 1 Resolve.
- After a comfortable rest during an adventure and you spend all of your Resolve, regain 1 Resolve.
- When the Players are especially creative during a scene or role-play exceptionally well, the GM can award each of them 1 Resolve.
