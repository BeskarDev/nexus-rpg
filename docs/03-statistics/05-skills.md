Any adventurer is capable of several different skills, which help them on their journeys.

## Skill Ranks

You can learn and improve your skills through ranks. When first learning a new skill, you start at rank 0 for it. The absolute pinnacle of expertise for a skill is rank 5, only reached by very few mortal souls. 

| Skill Rank | 0 (apprentice) | 1 (novice) | 2 (adept) | 3 (expert) | 4 (master) | 5 (grandmaster) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

**Expert Skills**

Special skills of knowledge or craftsmanship.

**Combat Skills**
