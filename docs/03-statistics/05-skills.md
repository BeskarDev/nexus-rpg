> "The difference between a mere survivor and a true legend isn't found in their weapons or birthrights, but in the skills they've honed through blood, sweat, and stubborn persistence."

## Skills Overview

Skills represent an adventurer's trained abilities that help them overcome challenges during their journey. While Attributes represent innate capabilities, Skills represent specialized training and experience that can be improved over time.

### Skill Ranks

All adventurers begin with certain Skills at different ranks. The ranks represent your level of expertise:

| Skill Rank | Title | XP Requirement | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Apprentice | 0 | Basic understanding with occasional success |
| 1 | Novice | 2 | Competent performance in standard situations |
| 2 | Adept | 6 | Skilled performance even under pressure |
| 3 | Expert | 12 | Advanced capabilities beyond most practitioners |
| 4 | Master | 18 | Exceptional talent recognized by many |
| 5 | Grandmaster | 24 | Legendary mastery achieved by few mortals |

When creating a new adventurer, you'll assign ranks to various Skills based on your character's background and training. As you gain experience points (XP) through adventures, you can spend them to increase your Skill ranks.

## Advancing Skills

As adventurers journey through the world, they gain experience points (XP) which can be spent to improve their Skills. To advance a Skill:

1. Spend the required XP shown in the Skill Ranks table during downtime
2. Describe how your adventurer trained or practiced to improve
3. Update your character sheet with the new rank

The GM may require that adventurers seek out specific training, mentors, or sacred sites to advance certain Skills beyond rank 3.

> **Important:** No Skill can be advanced beyond rank 5, which represents the pinnacle of mortal achievement.

When spending XP to advance a Skill, you pay only the difference between your current rank and the next rank. For example, advancing from rank 2 to rank 3 costs 6 XP (12 - 6 = 6).

## Using Skills

When an adventurer attempts something challenging with the chance of failure, they roll a skill test. Depending on the situation the GM will call for a specific Attribute and Skill combination to roll with. More details are described in the How to Roll section.
