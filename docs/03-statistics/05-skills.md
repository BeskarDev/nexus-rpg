# ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Skills

Any adventurer is capable of several different skills, which help them on their journeys.

## Skill Ranks

You can learn and improve your skills through ranks. When first learning a new skill, you start at rank 0 for it. The absolute pinnacle of expertise for a skill is rank 5, only reached by very few mortal souls. 

| Skill Rank | 0 (apprentice) | 1 (novice) | 2 (adept) | 3 (expert) | 4 (master) | 5 (grandmaster) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

************************Basic Skills************************

General skills every person can attempt, even without training for it.

********Expert Skills********

Special skills of knowledge or craftsmanship. Without training for them, you have little hope of succeeding at related tasks.

**************************Combat Skills**************************

Skills for fighting with weapons up close and afar. Handling a weapon without training is a bad idea.

Skills bestowed upon you by an arcane birthright, or hard fought through spiritual training. Very few people possess these skills and are either feared or revered for them.
