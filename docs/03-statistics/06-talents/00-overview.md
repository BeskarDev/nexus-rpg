# 🎯 Talents

![banner-img](/img/banner/talents-banner.png)

Talents are special abilities that enhance your character's capabilities in specific skills. Each skill has its own set of talents that you can learn as you advance in that skill's ranks.

## How Talents Work

- **Earning Talent Points**: Every **2 XP** you spend in a skill grants **1 talent point** for talents tied to that skill. Your **character level** limits how much XP you can put into any single skill.
- **Spending Talent Points**: Each talent rank costs **1 talent point**. Higher ranks of the same talent must be purchased in order (Rank 1 → Rank 2 → Rank 3).
- **Eligibility**: You can only buy a talent if you meet its **skill rank requirement** and you have enough talent points **from that same skill**.
- **Specialization**: Talents deepen your focus within a skill—pick the talents that match your playstyle and party needs.
