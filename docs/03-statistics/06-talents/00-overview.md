# 🎯 Talents

![banner-img](/img/banner/talents-banner.png)

Talents are special abilities that enhance your character's capabilities in specific skills. Each skill has its own set of talents that you can learn as you advance in that skill's ranks.

## How Talents Work

- **Learning Talents**: When you reach certain ranks in a skill (typically ranks 1, 2, 3, and sometimes 4), you can learn talents associated with that skill.
- **Rank Requirements**: Each talent has rank requirements. You must have the appropriate skill rank to learn that talent.
- **Stacking Ranks**: Many talents have multiple ranks (Rank 1, Rank 2, Rank 3). You typically must learn the lower ranks before learning higher ranks of the same talent.
- **Specialization**: Talents allow you to specialize your character within a skill, creating unique playstyles and strategies.
