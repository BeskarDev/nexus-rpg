**Peak Performance**  | <strong>(Rank 1)</strong> You temporarily utilize the full potential of a weapon or unit of ammo. You must have a crafting kit on you to use this ability.

**Quick Construction**  | <strong>(Rank 1) </strong>You are able to quickly improvise the construction of an item using what materials you have on hand. You must have a set of relevant tools on you to use this ability. During an exploration turn (one hour), choose any type of medium or smaller item of Quality 1 or 2 (no alchemical items, no armor). Roll Strength + Crafting and make a number of Supply checks for materials based on the item‘s size (one for small, two for medium). You have to have enough units of materials of the appropriate Quality for the amount of Supply checks you have to make (one unit for small items, at least d4 units for medium items).<br/>On a success, you create a quick-and-dirty version of that item. It is fragile, unsellable, has d4 Durability, and is automatically destroyed after a long duration.<br/><br/><strong>(Rank 2) </strong>When using Quick Construction, you can also create large items, such as a cart, a row of palisades, or a very long climbing rope. When doing so, roll vs. hard Difficulty (10) and make three Supply checks for materials. You also need to have at least d6 units of materials for large items.<br/><br/><strong>(Rank 3)</strong> When using Quick Construction, you can also create quick-and-dirty versions of Quality 3 items with materials of high-enough Quality. This includes all sorts of mechanical contraptions, such as a ballista, water wheel, or a simple crane.
