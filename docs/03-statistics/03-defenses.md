# ðŸ›¡ Defenses

![banner-img](/img/banner/defenses-banner.png)

> "Know your shields well, adventurer: quick feet to evade, strong arms to deflect, and an unwavering mind to withstand what cannot be avoided."
> 

When you are being attacked, the Target Number (TN) is always one of your three Defenses.

## Defense Types

| Defense | Used Against | Calculating Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Parry | Melee attacks, touch attacks | 7 + Fighting |
| Dodge | Ranged attacks, area effects | 5 + Â½ Agility |
| Resist | Mental attacks, environmental hazards | 5 + Â½ Spirit or Mind |

> Example: Sansar the Thief has an Agility attribute of d10, giving them a Dodge value of 10 (5 + 5). Once they reach level 3, their Defenses are increased by 1, giving them 11 Dodge. Likewise, increasing their Agility to d12 would also increase their Dodge by 1 more.

## Modifications and Limits

Defenses are further modified through character levels, talents, equipment, and magical effects but can never exceed a maximum value of 16 each.

## Using Quick Actions

Different abilities allow the adventurer to increase their Defenses temporarily or to defend with a different Defense than normal. For example, the defender can use a Quick Action to defend with Dodge instead of Parry against weapon attacks (this is called Evade).
