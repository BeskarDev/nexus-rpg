# ðŸ›¡ Defenses

When you are being attacked, the TN is always one of your three Defenses.

| Defense | used against | starting value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Parry | melee, touch | 7 + Fighting |
| Dodge | ranged, area | 5 + 1/2 Agility |
| Resist | mental, environmental | 5 + 1/2 Spirit |

Defenses are further modified through talents, equipment, and magical effects but can never exceed a maximum value of 14 each.

Different abilities also allow the user to increase their Defenses temporarily or to attack different Defenses than normal. For example, the defender can use a Reaction to defend with Dodge instead of Parry against weapon attacks.
