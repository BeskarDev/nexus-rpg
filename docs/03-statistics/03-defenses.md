# 🛡 Defenses

When being attacked, the TN is always one of the target’s three Defenses.

| Defense | used against | starting value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Parry | melee, touch | 7 + Fighting |
| Dodge | ranged, area | 5 + 1/2 Agility |
| Resist | mental, environmental | 5 + 1/2 Spirit |

Defenses are further modified through talents, equipment and magical effects. For example, all heavy armor reduces the wearer’s Dodge by a certain amount because of it’s rigid property.

Different abilities also allow the user to increase their Defenses temporarily or to attack different Defenses than normal. For example, the defender can use a Reaction to defend with Dodge instead of Parry against weapon attacks.
