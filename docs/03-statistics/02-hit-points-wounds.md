# ❤️ Hit Points & Wounds

![banner-img](/img/banner/hp-wounds-banner.png)

## Hit Points (HP)

HP is your short-term condition during a fight. When you take damage, first reduce it by your Armor Value (AV) and subtract the result (min. 1) from your HP. If you don’t have any HP left, you instead suffer Wounds (see below).

You start the game with HP equal to 12 + Strength (see the table below). With each Character Level above one you gain another +2 HP, which is also described in the Character Progression section. You regain all of your HP after you have time for a short break.

| Strength | d4 | d6 | d8 | d10 | d12 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HP | 16 | 18 | 20 | 22 | 24 |

You can also gain additional HP through talents, but you can never exceed 50 HP in total from all sources combined.

### Temporary HP

Some abilities and effects grant you temporary HP. This second pool of HP is first subtracted from when you take damage. It also doesn‘t replenish during a short break but is simply gone, once all of it has been taken away by damage taken.

If you gain temporary HP from multiple sources, you only gain the highest one among them.

## Wounds

> Most intelligent creatures consider surrender or fleeing when wounded. Seldom do fights between cultured individuals lead to death. Most often fights are decided earlier and consequences of failure are more often capture or theft, than death.
Besides, it is far more valuable to sell defeated foes back to their people than kill them outright and facing the wrath of their peers.

While HP determines your short-term endurance, Wounds displays your long-term health. When you run out of HP or are suffering from extreme conditions, you start to take Wounds in the form of either Injuries or Fatigue. 

Any Adventurer can take up to three Wounds from any combination of Injuries and Fatigue. When you suffer your first Wound, roll 1d4 and suffer the effects below as long as that Wound lasts.

1. **Broken Bone (upper body).** +1 bane on Strength rolls.
2. **Broken Bone (legs).** +1 bane on Agility rolls.
3. **Head Injury.** +1 bane on Spirit rolls.
4. **Concussion.** +1 bane on Mind rolls.

When you suffer your second Wound, roll another d4 - re-rolling the result you got for your first Wound. When you suffer your third Wound, you roll another d4 until it comes up with a result different from your first and second Wounds.

While Wounds from Fatigue heal relatively quickly, Wounds from Injuries take a lot of time to heal. When you suffer your third Wound, you also either start dying or fall unconscious, depending on whether your third Wound was from an Injury or Fatigue respectively.

### Injuries

You take an Injury whenever your HP is reduced to 0. While your HP is at 0, you suffer an Injury from any successful attack against you.

Whenever you take an Injury…

- and the damage is equal to or higher than your max HP —> suffer +1 Injury
- and the damage is equal to or higher than twice your max HP —> suffer +2 Injuries

> Note that attacks that deal damage to you multiple times from a single roll still only inflict one Injury to you. Only if the damage of any of the attack’s damage instances surpasses the above mentioned thresholds, do you take multiple Injuries from the attack.
> 

**Treating Injuries**

During a night‘s rest, you can attempt to treat one of your Injuries. Make a Supply check for your materials and roll Spirit/Mind + Nature. On a success, the Injury is treated and you no longer suffer its negative effect. The Injury re-opens when you are reduced to 0 HP again, which also results in you suffering its negative effect again.

**Healing Injuries**

You can permanently remove a treated Injury by succeeding on a hard Strength + Fortitude roll during another night‘s rest or downtime (see Downtime Activities for more detail).

### Fatigue

Non-lethal attacks inflict two Fatigue. You also suffer varying amounts of Fatigue from extreme conditions during travel, mental attacks, or other extremely exhausting activities. In contrast to Injuries, you need to suffer two Fatigue to suffer one Wound from it.

**Healing Fatigue**

During a night‘s rest, you remove two Fatigue. If you have a bad night, instead only remove one Fatigue.

> When suffering an Injury or Fatigue, mark one of your Wounds on your Adventurer Sheet with a | for an Injury. A ╱ marks your first Fatigue for a Wound. Add a ╲ for a second Fatigue of a Wound into the same Wound mark, so that both Fatigue together show a ╳.

If you first suffer one Fatigue and then one Injury, the Wound from the Injury counts as your first Wound, even if you suffer a second Fatigue later, and thus also suffering another Wound from having two Fatigue.
> 

## Dying

Once you suffer your third Wound with two or more Injuries, you start dying. When having two or more Fatigue, you fall unconscious instead.

When you first start dying, roll a d4.

When you roll the die, the result of the roll determines the amount of turns until you die. Reduce the die face by 1 on each of your following turns. During those turns you remain unconscious and dying. When a creature successfully attacks you while dying, you instantly die. Allies can also attempt to stop you from dying on their turns. With the right gear, another creature can make a Spirit + Nature roll.

**Weak.** +1 to the dice result.

**Strong.** +2 to the dice result.

**Critical.** You stop dying but remain unconscious.

When the dice result is brought to more than 4, you stop dying but remain unconscious.

Regaining HP while dying has no effect.
