# ❤️ Hit Points, Fatigue, and Wounds

![banner-img](/img/banner/hp-wounds-banner.png)

> "The difference between a seasoned adventurer and a corpse often comes down to knowing when another's blade has cut too deep. I've seen warriors continue fighting with three arrows in their chest, only to collapse when the battle fervor fades. The body can endure much, but wisdom lies in recognizing its limits."
> 

## Hit Points (HP)

Hit Points represent your short-term condition during conflict. When you take damage, first reduce it by your Armor Value (AV) and subtract the remainder (minimum 1) from your HP. If you have no HP remaining, you instead suffer a Wound (see below).

You begin with HP equal to 12 + Strength (see table). Each Character Level above one grants an additional +2 HP. You regain all HP after a short rest.

| Strength | d4 | d6 | d8 | d10 | d12 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Base HP | 16 | 18 | 20 | 22 | 24 |

Talents may provide additional HP, but your total HP from all sources cannot exceed 50.

### Temporary HP

Some abilities grant temporary HP—a secondary pool drawn from first when taking damage. Unlike regular HP, temporary HP doesn't replenish during short rests and vanishes once depleted.

When gaining temporary HP from multiple sources, only the highest value applies.

## Fatigue

Where HP represents your short-term condition and stamina, Fatigue covers your long-term endurance and physical energy. Each character can take up to 6 points of Fatigue. Each point of Fatigue reduces your max. HP by 2. You suffer points of Fatigue from special abilities, the strains of a long journey, or other environmental effects.

> Suffering a reduction of your max. HP doesn’t reduce your current HP if they were already below the new amount of max. HP.
> 

| Fatigue Points | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Max. HP Reduction | -2 max. HP | -4 max. HP | -6 max. HP | -8 max. HP | -10 max. HP | -12 max. HP |

Once you hit 6 points of Fatigue, you fall unconscious and only regain your consciousness after reducing your Fatigue naturally through rest or from other effects.

You naturally recover 2 points of Fatigue after a night’s rest or all of your Fatigue after a full rest.

## Wounds

> "In the grand markets of Sikatha, duels rarely end in death. A skilled combatant knows when to yield, and the victors understand that a living rival returned to their clan for ransom brings more wealth than a corpse. Even the fiercest warriors of the northern steppes follow this wisdom—only beasts and the truly desperate fight to the last breath."

While HP measures short-term endurance, Wounds reflect lasting damage to your body. An adventurer can sustain up to three Wounds before facing death.

When you suffer your first Wound, roll 1d4 and endure the effects below for as long as that Wound persists:

1. **Broken Bone (upper body):** +1 bane on Strength rolls
2. **Broken Bone (legs):** +1 bane on Agility rolls
3. **Head Injury (eyes, ears, nose, …):** +1 bane on Spirit rolls
4. **Concussion:** +1 bane on Mind rolls

For your second Wound, roll another d4, re-rolling if you get the same result as your first Wound. For your third Wound, roll until you get a result different from both previous Wounds.

When you suffer your third Wound, you also begin dying (see the Dying section below).

### Suffering Wounds

You sustain a Wound in the following circumstances:

- When your HP drops to 0
- When hit by an attack while at 0 HP
- When affected by certain special abilities, traps, or extreme environmental conditions

Additionally, when taking damage:

- If damage equals or exceeds your maximum HP → suffer +1 additional Wound
- If damage equals or exceeds twice your maximum HP → suffer +2 additional Wounds

> Note: Attacks dealing multiple instances of damage from a single roll still inflict only one Wound. Additional Wounds occur only when damage thresholds are surpassed.
> 

***Example:*** *Nagkhan the Sorcerer (22 max HP) is struck by a temple guardian's blade while at 0 HP. The attack deals 25 damage—more than Nagkhan's maximum HP—resulting in two Wounds total: one for being hit at 0 HP, and one for exceeding their maximum HP threshold.*

### Treating Wounds

During a night's rest, you may attempt to treat your Wounds. Roll Spirit/Mind + Nature once per Wound. On a success, the Wound is treated, and its negative effects cease. The Wound reopens if you drop to 0 HP again, reinstating its effects.

### Healing Wounds

To permanently remove a treated Wound, succeed on a hard Strength + Fortitude roll during a night's rest or during downtime.

> Example: After a fierce battle in an ancient tomb, Sephi the Seer has suffered two Wounds. During a night's rest, they make a successful Spirit + Nature roll with their healer's kit to treat one Wound. They circle one of the | marks on their character sheet to show the treated Wound, but still suffer the penalty from their untreated Wound.
> 

### Dying

When you suffer your third Wound, you begin dying. Roll a d4—the result indicates both how many turns remain before death and the difficulty of stabilization attempts. Reduce this count by 1 on each of your subsequent turns. While dying, you remain unconscious and helpless—any successful attack against you causes immediate death.

Allies may attempt to save you on their turns. With appropriate medical supplies, another creature can make a Spirit + Nature roll vs hard Difficulty (TN 10) to stabilize you.

Any successful stabilization roll immediately stops you from dying, though you remain unconscious with your current Wounds. A critical success also restores 1 HP, bringing you back to consciousness.

> Example: Arzhag the Warrior is struck down in battle against a temple guardian, suffering their third Wound. They begin dying and roll a 3 on their d4. On Arzhag's next turn, this count reduces to 2. Sansar rushes to their side and makes a Spirit + Nature roll with their healer's kit vs. hard Difficulty (TN 10). Despite the difficulty, Sansar succeeds! Arzhag is stabilized—no longer dying but still unconscious with three Wounds. Had Sansar achieved a critical success, Arzhag would have regained 1 HP and consciousness.

Regaining HP while dying has no effect on your dying condition—proper medical attention is required.
