# ðŸ’ª Attributes

There are 4 attributes in the game:

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Strength (STR) | Physical Power, Endurance, Grit |
| Agility (AGI) | Physical Speed, Precision, Mobility |
| Spirit (SPI) | Awareness, Intuition, Empathy |
| Mind (MND) | Mental Strength, Intelligence, Logic |

Each Attribute is represented by a Die Size and can be improved throughout the game:

| Die Size | Description |
| --- | --- |
| d4 | bad |
| d6 | average |
| d8 | good |
| d10 | excellent |
| d12 | incredible |

Different abilities and skills call for bonuses to be added depending on your attributes. For this, reference the table below.

|  | d4 | d6 | d8 | d10 | d12 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1/4 x Attribute | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 |
| 1/2 x Attribute | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 1 x Attribute | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 |
| 1.5 x Attribute | 6 | 9 | 12 | 15 | 18 |

## Improving Attributes

In the same adventurers can improve their skills, they can also improve their attributes with XP. Any adventurer can only ever improve one single attribute to a d12 and another second attribute to d10. The other two attributes can only ever be improved to d8 at most.

### Temporarily changing Attributes

Some effects from items, abilities, or spells modify certain attributes by increasing or decreasing them by a number of steps. When doing so, derivative statistics are not affected by the changed attribute (e.g. HP, or Focus). Only the rolled dice for tests with the changed attribute, or base damage based on it are affected.

If you would have to reduce an attribute from d4, it becomes d4-1. The same way an attribute already at d12 is increased to d12+1.
