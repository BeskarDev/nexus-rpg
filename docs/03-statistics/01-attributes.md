# 💪 Attributes

![banner-img](/img/banner/attributes-banner.png)

> "The four vessels of power granted to mortals—strength of body, quickness of movement, depth of spirit, and sharpness of mind—these define our path through the world and our legacy within it."

## The Four Attributes

Adventurers are defined by four fundamental attributes that represent their innate and developed capabilities:

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Strength (**STR**)** | Physical power, endurance, and fortitude |
| **Agility (AGI)** | Speed, precision, and graceful movement |
| **Spirit (SPI)** | Awareness, intuition, and connection to the unseen |
| **Mind (MND)** | Mental acuity, knowledge, and wisdom |

## Attribute Ratings

Each attribute is represented by a die size, reflecting your adventurer's capabilities in that area. As you journey and gain experience, these attributes will improve based on your specialization.

| Die Size | Rating | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **d4-1 or less** | Terrible | **STR**: Unable to carry basic equipment<br/>**AGI**: Constantly stumbling and tripping<br/>**SPI**: Oblivious to obvious dangers<br/>**MND**: Struggling with basic concepts |
| **d4** | Poor | **STR**: Quickly exhausted by physical labor<br/>**AGI**: Slow to react to sudden movements<br/>**SPI**: Missing common social cues<br/>**MND**: Frequently confused by new information |
| **d6** | Average | **STR**: Able to perform a day's labor<br/>**AGI**: Moving competently in most situations<br/>**SPI**: Sensing when something feels wrong<br/>**MND**: Understanding common knowledge and concepts |
| **d8** | Good | **STR**: Winning contests of might against ordinary folk<br/>**AGI**: Moving with precision through difficult terrain<br/>**SPI**: Perceiving hidden motives<br/>**MND**: Solving complex problems with ease |
| **d10** | Excellent | **STR**: Carrying burdens that would exhaust others<br/>**AGI**: Moving with perfect balance and coordination<br/>**SPI**: Reading intentions with uncanny accuracy<br/>**MND**: Mastering multiple fields of knowledge |
| **d12** | Incredible | **STR**: Breaking barriers thought impenetrable<br/>**AGI**: Moving faster than the eye can track<br/>**SPI**: Sensing things beyond mortal perception<br/>**MND**: Understanding knowledge long forgotten |
| **d12+1 or mode** | Monstrous | **STR**: Performing feats of strength from legends<br/>**AGI**: Moving with impossible grace and speed<br/>**SPI**: Perceiving across realms and dimensions<br/>**MND**: Comprehending knowledge beyond mortal understanding |

## Attribute Modifiers

When skills, abilities, or spells require calculations based on attributes, use the following table:

| Multiplier | d4-1 | d4 | d6 | d8 | d10 | d12 | d12+1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **¼ × Attribute** | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 |
| **½ × Attribute** | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| **1 × Attribute** | 3 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 | 13 |
| **1½ × Attribute** | 5 | 6 | 9 | 12 | 15 | 18 | 19 |

### Improving Attributes

As adventurers overcome challenges and grow in power, they may permanently increase their attributes when gaining levels. The path of improvement follows this progression:

```
d4 → d6 → d8 → d10 → d12
```

See the Character Progression section for details on when and how attributes may be improved.

> Example: After completing a dangerous quest, Sansar the Thief advances from level 3 to level 4. They choose to improve their Agility from d8 to d10, reflecting the incredible reflexes developed while dodging numerous traps and other dangers.

### Temporary Attribute Changes

Curses, blessings, potions, and magical effects may temporarily alter an adventurer's attributes:

- **Attribute Bonuses**: Increase the die size by the specified number of steps.
- **Attribute Penalties**: Decrease the die size by the specified number of steps.

> Important: Temporary changes to attributes do not affect derived statistics like Health Points or Focus. Only the dice rolled for attribute tests and base damage calculations are affected.

**Die Size Limits**

- An attribute reduced below d4 becomes d4-1
- An attribute improved beyond d12 becomes d12+1
- Additional changes beyond these extremes increase or decrease the modifier accordingly

> Example: Nagkhan the Sorcerer drinks a Potion of Might +2, increasing their Strength by two steps from d6 to d10 for a medium duration. When rolling with Strength to lift a fallen pillar, they roll a d10 rather than a d6, but their maximum Health Points remain unchanged.
