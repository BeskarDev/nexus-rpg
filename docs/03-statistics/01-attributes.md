> "The four vessels of power granted to mortalsâ€”strength of body, quickness of movement, depth of spirit, and sharpness of mindâ€”these define our path through the world and our legacy within it."
> 

## The Four Attributes

Adventurers are defined by four fundamental attributes that represent their innate and developed capabilities:

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Strength (**STR**)** | Physical power, endurance, and fortitude |
| **Agility (AGI)** | Speed, precision, and graceful movement |
| **Spirit (SPI)** | Awareness, intuition, and connection to the unseen |
| **Mind (MND)** | Mental acuity, knowledge, and wisdom |

## Attribute Ratings

Each attribute is represented by a die size, reflecting your adventurer's capabilities in that area. As you journey and gain experience, these attributes will improve based on your specialization.

| Die Size | Rating | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **d4-1 or less** | Terrible | **STR**: Unable to carry basic equipment<br/>**AGI**: Constantly stumbling and tripping<br/>**SPI**: Oblivious to obvious dangers<br/>**MND**: Struggling with basic concepts |
| **d4** | Poor | **STR**: Quickly exhausted by physical labor<br/>**AGI**: Slow to react to sudden movements<br/>**SPI**: Missing common social cues<br/>**MND**: Frequently confused by new information |
| **d6** | Average | **STR**: Able to perform a day's labor<br/>**AGI**: Moving competently in most situations<br/>**SPI**: Sensing when something feels wrong<br/>**MND**: Understanding common knowledge and concepts |
| **d8** | Good | **STR**: Winning contests of might against ordinary folk<br/>**AGI**: Moving with precision through difficult terrain<br/>**SPI**: Perceiving hidden motives<br/>**MND**: Solving complex problems with ease |
| **d10** | Excellent | **STR**: Carrying burdens that would exhaust others<br/>**AGI**: Moving with perfect balance and coordination<br/>**SPI**: Reading intentions with uncanny accuracy<br/>**MND**: Mastering multiple fields of knowledge |
| **d12** | Incredible | **STR**: Breaking barriers thought impenetrable<br/>**AGI**: Moving faster than the eye can track<br/>**SPI**: Sensing things beyond mortal perception<br/>**MND**: Understanding knowledge long forgotten |
| **d12+1 or mode** | Monstrous | **STR**: Performing feats of strength from legends<br/>**AGI**: Moving with impossible grace and speed<br/>**SPI**: Perceiving across realms and dimensions<br/>**MND**: Comprehending knowledge beyond mortal understanding |

## Attribute Modifiers

When skills, abilities, or spells require calculations based on attributes, use the following table:

| Multiplier | d4-1 | d4 | d6 | d8 | d10 | d12 | d12+1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Â¼ Ã— Attribute** | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 |
| **Â½ Ã— Attribute** | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| **1 Ã— Attribute** | 3 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 | 13 |
| **1Â½ Ã— Attribute** | 5 | 6 | 9 | 12 | 15 | 18 | 19 |

### Improving Attributes

As adventurers overcome challenges and grow in power, they may permanently increase their attributes when gaining levels. The path of improvement follows this progression:

```
d4 â†’ d6 â†’ d8 â†’ d10 â†’ d12
```

See the Character Progression section for details on when and how attributes may be improved.

> Example: After completing a dangerous quest, Sansar the Thief advances from level 3 to level 4. They choose to improve their Agility from d8 to d10, reflecting the incredible reflexes developed while dodging numerous traps and other dangers.
> 

### Temporary Attribute Changes

Curses, blessings, potions, and magical effects may temporarily alter an adventurer's attributes:

- **Attribute Bonuses**: Increase the die size by the specified number of steps.
- **Attribute Penalties**: Decrease the die size by the specified number of steps.

> Important: Temporary changes to attributes do not affect derived statistics like Health Points or Focus. Only the dice rolled for attribute tests and base damage calculations are affected.
> 

**Die Size Limits**

- An attribute reduced below d4 becomes d4-1
- An attribute improved beyond d12 becomes d12+1
- Additional changes beyond these extremes increase or decrease the modifier accordingly

> Example: Nagkhan the Sorcerer drinks a Potion of Might +2, increasing their Strength by two steps from d6 to d10 for a medium duration. When rolling with Strength to lift a fallen pillar, they roll a d10 rather than a d6, but their maximum Health Points remain unchanged.
