# ðŸ’ª Attributes

![banner-img](/img/banner/attributes-banner.png)

There are 4 attributes in the game:

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Strength (STR) | Physical Power, Endurance, Grit |
| Agility (AGI) | Physical Speed, Precision, Mobility |
| Spirit (SPI) | Awareness, Intuition, Empathy |
| Mind (MND) | Mental Strength, Intelligence, Logic |

Each Attribute is represented by a die size and can be improved throughout the game:

| Die Size | Description | Examples (STR, AGI, SPI, MND) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| d4-1 or less | terrible | feeble body, constantly tripping over your own feet, oblivious to your surroundings, or animalistic Intelligence |
| d4 | bad | quickly out of breath, slow and clumsy, struggling to understand others, or often irrational |
| d6 | decent | moderate endurance, decently fast and precise, sufficiently aware and empathetic, or no problems with logical thinking |
| d8 | good | resilient and tough, capable of quick and controlled movements, highly perceptive, or adept at problem-solving and logical reasoning |
| d10 | excellent | remarkable physical power and unwavering endurance, nimble and lightning-fast, exceptionally aware and deeply insightful, or master of complex logic and strategy |
| d12 | incredible | capable of superhuman feats of strength and endurance, moving with blinding speed and astonishing precision, supernatural awareness and intuition, or genius-level intellect |
| d12+1 or more | monstrous | titanic physical power and seeming almost indestructible, speed and mobility defying the laws of physics, bordering on omniscience, or possessing knowledge and insight beyond mortal comprehension. |

Different abilities and skills call for bonuses to be added depending on your attributes. For this, reference the table below.

|  | d4-1 | d4 | d6 | d8 | d10 | d12 | d12+1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1/4 x Attribute | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 |
| 1/2 x Attribute | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| 1 x Attribute | 3 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 | 13 |
| 1.5 x Attribute | 5 | 6 | 9 | 12 | 15 | 18 | 19 |

## Improving Attributes

In the same adventurers can improve their skills, they can also improve their attributes with XP. Any adventurer can only ever improve one single attribute to a d12 and another second attribute to a d10. The other two attributes can only ever be improved to d8 at most.

Improving an attribute by one die size requires spending 4 XP and one week of downtime.

### Temporarily changing Attributes

Some effects from items, abilities, or spells modify certain attributes by increasing or decreasing them by several steps. When doing so, derivative statistics are not affected by the changed attribute (e.g. HP, or Focus). Only the rolled dice for tests with the changed attribute, or base damage based on it are affected.

If you would have to reduce an attribute from d4, it becomes d4-1. In the same way, an attribute already at d12 is increased to d12+1. Additional changes would further decrease or increase the modifier respectively.
