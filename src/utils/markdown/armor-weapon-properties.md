**agile** | You can roll attacks with Agility instead of Strength. When doing so, also use Agility as your base damage.
**ammo** | Needs ammunition to attack.
**AV +X** | Increases your Armor Value (AV) by X.
**blowpipe** | Attacking an unaware target with this weapon doesn’t reveal your position. Hitting with this weapon, while its ammo is coated in any kind of poison, allows you to multiply that poison’s damage by your attack’s SL the same way you do for weapon damage (weak: x1, strong: x2, or critical: x3).
**bundle (dX)** | This type of weapon comes in a bundle of multiple weapons, usually for throwing purposes. The same as with ammo, you have to make a Supply check at the end of combat for attacking withthe weapons from the bundle. Any effects, such as enchantments or weapon poisons apply to every item from the bundle.<br/>You can also use a bundle weapon in melee, but suffer +1 bane on attacks because of it’s small size. You can also dual-wield weapons from the same bundle in melee and at range, if you have more than one left (d4 or more).<br/>
**covering** | Can be placed down using an Action to act as a stationary cover from a direction of your choice without you holding the item. You can use another Action to pick the item up again. 
**crush** | Ignore 1/2 of the enemy’s AV (rounded up). If you gain this effect from multiple sources, you ignore all of the enemy’s AV instead.
**damaged** | You suffer +1 bane on attacks with a weapon or the AV bonus is halved for armor, helmets, or shields (min. 0). Another failed Durability check for this item destroys it, making it unusable until repaired.
**double-sided** | This weapon can be used like dual-wielding two light weapons of the same type.
**entangle** | Before making an attack against a target the same size or smaller than you, you can choose to also grapple the target. When doing so, this attack also counts as a Grapple Action. On a hit, the target is grappled by your weapon. The grapple ends early when you make another attack with this weapon unless it is a bundle weapon.
**fragile** | You must roll a Durability Check for this item after each use. This includes after each hit for a weapon or after each time you are hit by an attack for a shield, helmet, or armor. 
**heavy (dX)** | For each Strength value below dX, suffer +1 bane on attacks for weapons or +1 bane on all Strength rolls for armor.
**light** | Can be dual-wielded.
**narrowed** | You suffer +1 bane on Perception rolls (including Initiative).
**noisy** | You suffer +1 bane on Cunning rolls (including surprising enemies).
**parry X** | Increase your Parry by X. You can only benefit from one held item with this property at a time.
**pierce** | If you fail an attack roll, you can re-roll the test once between your turns.
**range (normal/max)** | You can attack with this ranged weapon at the given normal range. When attacking a target further away, you suffer +1 bane for each range step beyond your normal range, up to your max. distance.
**reach** | You can attack enemies at close range. While any enemy is within melee range of you, you suffer +1 bane on the attack.
**reload** | After attacking with this weapon, it needs to be reloaded before you can make another attack with it. As an Action or by skipping all Movement during your turn, you can reload the weapon.
**rigid X** | You suffer +X bane(s) on the following rolls:<br/>- Strength rolls for physical exertion during travel, climbing, swimming, or sprinting.<br/>- Agility rolls.<br/>- Arcana rolls to cast spells. <br/>If you wear or wield multiple rigid items, you suffer all their penalties combined.<br/>
**slash** | On a hit against an enemy in light or no armor, add your weapon damage an additional time to the total damage.
**switch** | Choose one of the properties listed for this weapon to gain for an attack. If you make multiple attacks during the same turn, switch between the listed properties for each individual attack.
**thrown (normal/max)** | This weapon or its ammo can be thrown for ranged attacks at the given normal range. When attacking a target further away, you suffer +1 bane for each range step beyond your normal range, up to your max. distance.<br/>You can roll thrown attacks with Strength instead of Agility (also for the base damage) and Fighting instead of Archery (choose any combination of either option). If the weapon is thrown, it is treated as a thrown ranged weapon even if it is normally a melee weapon.<br/>
**two-handed** | Requires both hands to attack. You can still choose to attack with only one hand but suffer +2 banes on the attack roll.
**versatile (+X)** | This weapon can also be used with both hands. When doing so, it is treated as a two-handed weapon and deals +X weapon damage. Creatures smaller than medium size can only wield this weapon two-handed and don‘t add any bonus damage.
